A1004AX2J2HXGL B00003CXE7 December 19, 2003 5 25 1.0 Meditations? This movie was lots of fun. The story was so gritty and affecting. I remember after watching it for the first time, I made my own sword from scrap wood & laid into some mailboxes and windshields. Ancient Rome burned in my heart. GLADIATOR charges the blood with electricity. The characters are so compelling, deep and human. The villain, played to perfection by Joaquin Phoenix, was pure brilliance. Russell Crowe dips his hand into the gritty Earth and produces a hero of uncommon, brutal honesty. The lions, the vicious cheers of a blood-thirsty crowd... I give this movie exactly ONE STAR. The story, even for an epic, was compelling for a grand total of five minutes. The plot blunders predictably along, creating little or no emotional momentum & absolutely no sense of adventure. Kids in a sandbox could contrive a better story than this piece of garbage. About an hour into this vacuum, I just wanted Russell Crowe to kill Commodus so I could get back to my life. Joaquin Phoenix "vexed" me with his paper thin performance as the twisted, impotent usurper. Perhaps Phoenix can't be blamed for the job he turned in? They gave him such a narrow, cardboard role to play - a weak foil to the driven, fertile, masculine Maximus. There was no descent into madness; something vaguely human that would have at least given some dimension to this silly story. Ridley Scott created a beautiful film. The cinematography was masterful - like a crazy European car commercial. A wild, powerful sports car rolls into the coliseum, everyone stops their torturous acting & begins to feel the fine interiors, check under the hood, blare some music and then comment on the trunk space. Maybe a quick ride to showcase the vehicle's performance? A lion could sit on the hood and roar a little bit - an obvious appeal to the grunting desire to identify with virility and power that lurks in all of us. Oh well. The mass appeal of this bore was a clear demonstration of the famous quote: "a sucker is born every minute." 
A1004AX2J2HXGL B000005JAC October 6, 2003 5 5 5.0 punk vs. passion First time I heard this album, I was ready to toss it out the window or use it as an ashtray. I put it away - then pulled it out again several months later when I took a third shift job... the punchline is I love this thing! I can imagine dark streets, flying carpets and industrial wretchedness. Perfect! It sounds like third world music being played on conventional rock instruments. Lots of sprawling, tribal-like drums coupled with J. Lydon's screeching, odd voice - all other sounds fill the gap between the two. Lydon's voice seems more at home on this album more than anything else he has done. "Flowers of Romance" is an aggressive antithesis to popular music of that time. Not surprising. I especially love the track entitled PHENAGEN - beautiful, almost religious chanting. I wonder if PIL will ever get their due? Maybe one those instances, much like the Stooges or VU before them, when twenty years later someone decides this is actually great music? I'm glad I found out sooner than later... 
A100TW8FZECWD6 B00006FDQR October 8, 2002 14 16 5.0 No more gray box of death Apple gets a bad rap for having "pricey" computers, but I've never found them to be such. Just look at what this baby comes with: 256 MB RAM. The wonderful G4 processor, at 800 MHz, which is deceptively fast. 80 GB Ultra ATA Hard Drive The SuperDrive which lets me burn CDs and DVDs. A crystal clear 17" flat panel display. Flat panel monitors run into the HUNDREDS of dollars by themselves (...). 10/100 Base-T ethernet port. TWO FireWire Ports FIVE USB ports (three on the console, two on the keyboard) NVIDIA GForce 4 MX Graphics card Apple Pro Optical Mouse Apple Pro speakers, and they are outstanding. Built-in Microphone Built in Airport antenna, for wireless networking. Mac OS 9 and the luscious, UNIX-based Jaguar (OS X 10.2) AppleWorks, a convenient suite of Office-type apps. Their database app is one of the easiest and friendliest around. I store lists of books, CDs and other such things with it. Explorer Quicken The amazing iApps: iChat, iMovie, iPhoto, iDVD and iTunes, all of which make computing so easy and fun in the digital age. And still more apps--too many to list here. To buy a quality PC with all of these things would cost about the same, if not more. The ports alone make this a good investment. Best of all, I know all the things in this computer will work together. That's what having a Mac is all about. As always, Apple doesn't do anything on the cheap, not even with their "everyman" computers, like the iMac. Everything here is top of the line, and it all works beautifully. The most taxing thing about setting up the computer was getting it out of the box (the design makes it more fragile than most computers). Once I had that done, I had it up and running in about 15 minutes--and some of that time was spent upgrading to Jaguar. Connecting to my husband's Powerbook through our DSL router was as easy as clicking on Connect to Server, then clicking on his computer in the listbox. Jaguar even recognized my son's PC, and I was yanking mp3s off there, very fast. The computer itself is very quiet, although the SuperDrive can get rather noisy at times. But the hard drive? Barely a peep out of it. The display is crisp and clean. The screen really does move with the touch of one finger--smoothly, effortlessly. The G4 processor screams through apps. Burning mp3s and CDs has never been easier, thanks to iTunes. Downloading mp3s and audio books to my iPod is a dream--and speedy indeed over the FireWire connection. I made a DVD the other day of just some clips that I'd collected over the years, and it was disgustingly easy with iDVD. I connected my new Olympus digital camera through the USB port; iPhoto popped right up and filled up the screen with thumbnails of my digital images--with only one click asking if I wanted iPhoto to always do that. Everything just WORKS with this computer, seamlessly, flawlessly, which has been the most refreshing thing about switching to Apple. But let's face it: Besides the fact that it's a Macintosh, which means a user-friendly computer with quality hardware, the real reason anyone buys this new iMac is because its design is flat-out cool. It is so beautiful that, even weeks after receiving it, I'll just sit there staring at it, still amazed that THIS is a computer. Having my computer's circuitry nestled under a dome rather than entombed in yet another rectangular box is a delight. A round computer case! Who but Apple would have thought of it? Everybody will copy this idea (Gateway[snort!] has already tried), but, as usual, no one will come close to matching the sheer ingenuity of what Apple has done. Don't be fooled by wannabes. This is the real thing, and it's worth every penny you'll spend on it--and then some. 
A100TW8FZECWD6 0553580132 August 23, 2000 3 3 5.0 So glad I found this book Normally, I'm not a fan of Westerns, but something told me to give this book a try when I saw it at the bookstore. I'm glad I obeyed the instinct. Painted by the Sun is about Shea Waterston, a traveling photographer who is following the orphan trains west to look for the son she gave up a decade before. While setting up her camera to photograph a hanging, she meets Judge Cameron Gallimore, who promptly throws her--and her camera--in jail. The Judge, however, has demons of his own, and he and Shea recognize each other as kindred spirits. Elizabeth Grayson writes beautifully about 1870s Colorado and a relationship between two tortured individuals who are inherently decent people. Cam's sister, Lily, his son, Rand, and Rand's friend, Tyler, are well-portrayed. Shea, especially, is a wonderful character. Unlike most romance heroines, she is no prissy, helpless virgin. Shea is pragmatic, self-sufficient, and experienced. And don't cross her, or someone she cares about, if she has her Winchester rifle nearby! This is a wonderful book. Read it! 
A100UZ3LRLU135 0375501843 July 8, 2005 9 9 5.0 An Artful Novel When I opened the cover of this book which I read for my bookclub, I was nervous. Not only was there a map of Northern Italy, but there was a list of several pages of characters whose names seemed vaguely similar. I thought, "Oh, here we go. I never like when I need roadmaps to read a story..." Yet immediately I was plunged into a tale so tragic but joyful, complex and yet simple at the same time, I was hooked. This is not what I would consider an easy read. I spent a good deal of time going back to read a page again because the pace of the novel is, at times, feverish. But I am always a fan of the novel as an experience and this book gave that to me. I emotionally reacted to the characters, at times I felt as out of breath as they were, sometimes I was confused. But in the end, I grew to love them as people. To me this is a testament to the fullness of their portraits drawn by a skillful, if at times ambitious, writer. In the middle of reading this novel I had the pleasure of meeting Mary Doria Russell, so perhaps this skews my review positively, but that doesn't make me change it. Based on my experience with her earlier work, this one makes me a full member of her fan club. MDR comes into her own through these clever people who knew such pain and terror but also love and life. Usually, I base my rating of a book on whether I would actually sit down and read the entire thing a second time. With this one, I emphatically would. MDR deserves all the praises she gets for this intricately-woven story. 
A100YHBWL4TR4D 0425171078 May 21, 2000 2 2 5.0 Fun, light fantasy I really enjoyed this book. OK, so I am still not clear about how Kurland's time travel theory works -- I guess I like to see something more substantial than just wishing. I loved Richard myself. This book is sensual without being smutty -- sex is not described in graphic detail. I would feel comfortable recommending this book to my high school students. The medieval details were authentic and accurate. This book rates above most romance novels I have read. 
A100YHBWL4TR4D 0064405842 December 26, 1999 1 2 5.0 One of the best books ever written for young adults This book is one of my favorite books of all time. Karen Cushman perfectly captures life for a young teenage girl in the Middle Ages. From mundane, everyday problems like fleas to major concerns like familial expectations and marriage, Cushman covers it all! This is one of the few books that is so accurate that readers can really get a feel for the times as they truly were - not the way they are romanticized. I say kudos to Cushman, and I hope she keeps them coming! 
A100ZQDV7L8PVV B0006I8I3M April 25, 2006 1 1 2.0 glasses that give you hat hair The concept is cute, although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head. Regular glasses go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out. If you never take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you. Otherwise, conventional glasses are a better bet. 
A100ZQDV7L8PVV 0934426988 September 29, 2003 17 19 4.0 Essential oils certainly were available in Biblical Times I have seen numerous slides of essential oil distilleries from ancient Judea, Pakistan and other places in the Near East, which vary significantly from distilleries for alcohol. The distilled oils were floated on water before exiting the drum. Essential oils were certainly available, although it is likely that common folk used infused oils because of their lesser cost. Dr. Stewart has put together some excellent information on the use of oils in Biblical times. 
A101AFHY8G9PCV B00005JNEI September 26, 2004 15 23 5.0 True Patriot This film was touching, truthful, and rightfully damaging to the regime we call the bush administration. All republicans do to condemn this movie, which most dont even watch, is say it is full of lies, which it is not, if so-prove it! They cry "Moore has an agenda to get Bush thrown from the whitehouse because he is biased". Of course he is! When your president is so completely unfit for his command why would you not be biased towards him. Get him out and try something new. I often laugh when debating a repub over our president , because they are so brainwashed and argue about a movie that in my experience they hadnt even watched. I ask, how can you argue that point when you havent even watched it. And the reply is "Yeah...and ill never watch that garbage. " I mean come on! Pathetic is a word that comes to mind. There may be others as well. Get some balls, watch the movie, try not to let your head explode with frustration as you wonder how your president could be so careless. Then in typical republican fashion just disclaim the film as all lies! LOL. You have no argument. Wake up. The proof isnt just in the film, but in the feelings of many soldiers in iraq right now. In the feelings of hundreds of protestors at every single stop Bush makes across the country. A country divided more than ever. There has to be something to these strong feelings. Its time for our own regime change. Wake up America - Bush doesnt care about you. Michael Moore should be saluted for his bravery. The patriot act probably has him classified as an enemy combatant now. 
A101OAAMZYWQ3U B0001VQEYY January 26, 2005 5 5 2.0 Worked fine for 9 months... This DVD player worked just fine for around 9 months and now something has gone wrong with the processor- I no longer get any output to the subwoofer channel from either the Digital Coax or the analogue multichannel outputs. I am also starting to notice that the surround channels cut out frequently. Too bad that the warranty only lasted for 3 months... 
A101OAAMZYWQ3U B0000632GL March 17, 2004 2 2 5.0 AWE-inspiring! Incredible sound! I purchased a pair of these speakers with a JBL 12" sub and I'll have to say that my music never sounded so good. The resolution and presence is incredible! As for movies, the depth charges in U-571 just about blew out our windows. 
A101X5KFOHP7TC 0399151613 July 27, 2004 14 18 2.0 Great Marketing I received this book as a birthday present, having earned the reputation as being one of the largest Jane Austen fans in existence, at the age of 14 I knew Pride and Prejudice better then the back of my hand, having read the book more then 25 times, and since then many more. Austen's other books I, no doubt, no as well as the back of my hand, I just happen to give preference to Pride and Prejudice. When I was given this book, I was expecting more talk of Austen's books and more intertwining of their plots with those of Fowler's. The main problem with this book is just that. I, and I am sure many others, pick this book up to hear about Austen, and Austen's brilliant characters, however this is not the object of this novel. This is a book about Fowler's characters. She wants us to care about her characters not about Elizabeth Bennet, Emma Woodhouse, and Marianne Dashwood, and Austen's other great characters. This brings me to the next problem, which relates to this previous one, and that is that the characters of Fowler's creation can not stand up to those of Austen's, since 'Against giants even great mortals look small.' While Fowler's characters are not bad, they are not great, they are all to particular, to extreme, to 'unique', these traits, usually desirable in characters, in Fowlers case one must say that there is to much of a good thing. All her characters come of a flat. Overdone. And unbelievable. They already have a hard task set before them; to live up to Austen's followers' expectations of characters is difficult, but not unachievable. These characters do not make it. Indeed they are still miles away from it. Apart from the characters faults, the writing itself is awkward and uneven. At times she seems to have got it and then within a page she has once again dropped the thread, this creates difficulties in the reading. I would not recommend the purchase of this book. If you really must read it, wait till your library gets it. However, I would recommend that your time would be far better spent rereading Jane Austen herself. Since this book provides no real discussion of Austen's books, read them for your self and then discus them with someone. You will get far more out of it, and it will be much more enjoyable. 
A1020L7BWW9RAX B000BC8T3M April 6, 2006 0 0 4.0 Just a good dope record! Jnerio Jarel? Who that be? This is what I thought when I received this album in the mail to put in rotation at my radio station. Well this kid turns out to be a producer extraordinaire who happens to emcee just a little bit to. As soon as you pop this album in you are welcomed to his world which is just a little different. Presently residing in Philly he has spent much of his life all over the place. Born in Brooklyn, acquiring the art of rhyme in Houston and perfecting it in New York (with stops in many other places in between) Jarel has a wide range of influences that make his album that much more intriguing. With obvious ties to the Philly "Sound" his style is all his own with influences ranging from the Native Tongues to Soul & Jazz, and even to that Madlib funk. Jnerio gives us an album that is both instrumental and rhymed on. Some tracks he delivers that classic soul vibe and he may throw some ad-libs in (and you thought only commercial artists did this!) with a singer such as Vinia Mojica, of Reflection Eternal fame, crooning away like it was a jam session with the around the way band. Or he may just deliver a straight up hip hop cut where he flows to a beat that he cooked up with who knows how many samples layered in. Overall Jnerio delivers an album that is more like an unsolvable puzzle: the combination of styles, samples, and guests will prevent you from ever fully completing it, but they will also leave you no choice but to keep coming back to it. 
A1020L7BWW9RAX B000BBOVC6 January 6, 2006 1 3 4.0 This album is GOOD!!! Pharcyde has been around for a moment in this world of hip-hop and they have had their break ups and regrouping. Well the former leader of this fun crew of emcees has finally dropped his solo joint and I must say that he delivered a dope album. This thing is fresh, I don't care if the lead single came out 5 years ago or not. Everyone that is hating on the album because it took so long take one listen to "Writers Block" (9) and tell me that you are still mad at him. He put his heart and soul into this album and it shows. It has the typical funky and fun vibe of traditional Pharcyde all the while lyrical content that really is impressive for today's hip hop. He does not kill you with intelligent rhymes that are over your head, he just delivers every man, every day rap from the soul. He talks to his kids on "Dreams" (19), he tells the story of him and his girl on "The Story of Us" (11), and reintroduces himself over some crazy synth strings on the intro "Fat Leezy" (1). The one weak side to this album is a lot of the songs have cheesy choruses that bring it down at times, but overall this album is really dope and I wish I had discovered it sooner. 
A1020L7BWW9RAX B000A9QKCS September 15, 2005 1 2 5.0 hip hop thats fun, inteligent & you can dance to it? Lots of talk and speculation but what's the deal about this crew outta NC called The Justus League? They are taking this hip-hop back to the days when hip-hop was fun and had meaning! This is what hip-hop is all about right here. 9th Wonder, Big Pooh & Phonte just know how to put it down and they do not compromise themselves one bit (which is nice to see from a major label). I know that 9th has been sounding a little tired as of late but he was just saving it for his boys. He worked in a real studio this time around and it shows. His samples are tighter, his drums hit crisper & the overall sound is warmer. Phonte and Big Pooh are both still evolving lyricists, but at the same time they are very precise with their words and flow. They are kept on their toes by the young bucks in their crew who they have guest on this album. Joe Scudda continues to impress me with his verse on "Love It" and Darien Brockington needs to teach these so called R&B cats out today what real soul music is. You find lots of subjects touched on, but it is always second to the overall theme of the album, which is trying to show the world that hip-hop is dope beats & dope rhymes about something, and above all its about having fun. We have lost that in a lot of today's big hip hop stars and Little Bro gets props for taking a stand on something they believe in. I loved "The Listening" and did not expect them to top it but the more I hear this album the more I think they may have. It is not that "The Listening" was a bad album so much as this album is just more whole. I find it having a familiar feeling. It almost seems like you have been listening to it for years and you just copped it yesterday. 
A1020L7BWW9RAX B0007GP61U April 11, 2005 1 2 4.0 Some amazing seattle Hip Hop (3.5 Stars) Oldominion's Onry Ozzborn and JFK come together as Reason & Recluse respectively to form Grayskul and deliver some dark hip hop that only Seattle could breed. They are also joined by bass player Rob Castro who produces one track and lays bass lines down on other tracks. These two emcees both with Latino heritage create an album that is both bumpin and interesting. Due to their cultural ties they deliver songs that speak on ancient rituals and spirits just as much as they are talking about Seattle and how they are super heroes here to save hip hop. They are here to save hip hop with some real lyrics that are more than just dealing drugs and gang banging. Having been around for awhile now they brought in underground heavy hitters Canibus, Aesop Rock, and Mr.Lif to name a few guests and they hold their own next to these lyrical geniuses. The beats are all dark and have a very special feel especially if you have spent any time in Seattle. They harnessed that dreary feeling that looms over the city more days then I care to count and delivered and very good hip hop album not just for Seattle artists but for hip hop in general. 
A1020L7BWW9RAX B0007KTBEE March 7, 2005 0 0 4.0 If only he had some better emcees! (3.5 Stars) Chicago has been doing some big things on the hip hop tip lately and here is the latest from the windy city. For a debut album he shows off his production skills quite well, while putting his emcee duties on the back burner. Instead he pulls in a bunch of mostly unknown cats to rip it over his amazing beats. These guys don't do a bad job but they are not on the same caliber of most of his musical offerings. The intro track is just a moody instrumental with some really perfect samples scratched in for added effect. On the posse cut "Dreams" (5), Diverse continues spittin pure fire just like he did on his solo debut. He is joined by Longshot and Profound, two other rappers that hold their own. Boston legend Edo G comes in for a solid track with "Take'N'Over" (16) and Copperpot constructs a Pete Rock esque beat for him to tear apart. This album has one major flaw: While the emcees are not weak most of them do not do Copperpot's beats justice. He has constructed some of the better beats for an indy album in awhile but they are laced with rappers that either need help with flow or content (battle raps are tight in a battle, not on an album). If you're a beat fiend check this album if you like thought provoking lyrics go pick up Qwel's album. 
A1020L7BWW9RAX B00005AV09 December 8, 2004 2 3 4.0 Raw & Uncut Hip-Hop Jazzyness This album is so tight. I don't know how to explain it. Pete Rock is definetly top 5 producers ever. He mixes the samples up and always comes with that hot beat. Track 13 is amazing, very mellow but at the same time it gets you hyped up. All these songs are hot. Track 8 with CL Smooth is sick. It shows that pete rock and CL should come back and hit us with that heat, it would be certifiable classic 4 sure. Back to this album, pete does some sick outros and intro's to tracks that are really cool, just a short like 10-15 seconds of a tight jazz sample with a hot bassline. This album is a great album for any aspiring rappers. I personally used two of the beats for my first album, but know i got the MPC and makin my own beats. Bottem line Pete Rock is hot and delivers an instrumental album that flows smoothly. Play Dis At Night is one of the smoothest beats i have ever heard with a crazy jazz sample. Petes Jazz is just that some hot jazz that Pete took to a whole other level. The UN are hot but the best track with a rapper on here is "Nothin Lesser" with Freddie Foxx. The Bonus track with the UN #15 is crazy. The Keys that he has in their are sick. So yes indeed this album is hot and i must say you gots to cop it AS SOON AS POSSIBLE its hot as hell 
A1020L7BWW9RAX B0001CNQHG October 27, 2004 0 0 4.0 SEE THEM LIVE Modern day west coast Wu-Tang? I think so. The Visionaries are 5 emcees and 1 DJ. They come back strong for their third album. A vast array of west coast producers create the musical backdrop for these guys to spit their lyrics. They are solid all the way through. "Nine Eleven" is one of the best songs about 9/11 with lines like "The only enemy is evil/Not other countries, races, colors, or creeds" they are socially conscious and still bangin. They come with some good party tracks like "Strike" & "Momentum". This is a great album be sure to check for it. 
A10250WFWWKGWV 0300106645 May 10, 2006 5 5 5.0 Can all men be turned into Metrosexuals? Some of these reviews may give the idea that Manliness is about squashing beer cans on your head at monster truck rallies. But Mansfield is a deep thinker and this is a thoroughgoing analysis of a human characteristic that isn't going anywhere but isn't being examined or even acknowledged either. While some schools of feminism seem almost to wish men off the planet rather than examine gender differences in any kind of even handed way Mansfield is quite specific that feminism is not the reason manliness has become the virtue that dare not speak its name. It is rather "the entire enterprise of modernity." [p. 230] Manliness is a deeply philosophical examination of a characteristic of humanity drawing on a pantheon of thinkers from a broad spectrum of thought. That the term manliness seems gratuitously to award a virtue to approximately half of the human race is a semantic stumbling block that many will be unable to overcome. For the true scholar of gender issues Manliness is on the assigned reading list. Get to it. 
A10250WFWWKGWV 0345470613 January 16, 2006 1 1 4.0 Saddest thing I have ever read I seldom read fiction and when I do it is usually spy or detective stories. I read this because the description reminded me of my wife and I. It is painfully, PAINFULLY sad but very good. Tyler has a true gift for creating characters and places and bringing them along over years and decades. I am sure her other works are well crafted but I don't think I could stand to feel this way again if I could possibly help it. 
A1025UG0K6EF5X B00004WLLA February 21, 2002 0 0 5.0 Take this on your next road trip! My 4.5 year old son loves this album in the car! He is a HUGE Jeffrey fan and I think this is his favorite album. Our favotites are Snortin Nortin, Everybody Loves Grandma,and Something Smells (its my nose). The last one sends my son into fits of laughter. Jeffrey really understands kids and seems to have the ability to reach them through his music. WE LOVE JEFFREY!

A1025UG0K6EF5X 0809239965 May 7, 1998 0 0 5.0 A must-have for every new parent! I found this book just after my son was born and the cartoons were so funny (and so true) that I laughed to the point of crying. I can't wait to read the rest of the series! 
A102KJ9K5Q20PA 0936184531 October 17, 2001 46 48 4.0 The Science of Good Cooking The Best Recipe books have an interesting perspective on cooking and cookbooks. Resolutely scientific, recipes are developed in their test kitchens according to methodical experimentation -- you get not only the best recipe, but insight into the variations of the recipe that failed. This makes for interesting reading, and highlights many practical errors and pitfalls that spoil a good clam chowder or weaken a chicken paprikash. For example, they put to test the idea that beef bourguignon is only as good as the wine used in the cooking. (The answer, sadly, is yes -- good wine makes better beef bourguignon.) In many places, this puts them at odds with staunch traditionalists, advocating, for example, the use of canned stock in certain dishes (which is tantamount for many cooks to a heresy). The systematic approach might then threaten the art of cooking, while advocating a new scientific approach, but the results in my experience (not only this book but also from cooking illustrated from which the recipes are drawn) tend to be quite good -- and like any good scientific result, reliable. It is worth noting that because of this detailed approach to classic dishes as problems that must be solved, there are relatively few recipes in the book relative to its length. I enjoy the reports, though they might put off someone looking for straightforward recipes. 
A102KJ9K5Q20PA 1568581688 June 27, 2001 6 8 2.0 Strangely dispassionate and haunted work I read this book after hearing it recommended on NPR. It was hard when coming to the book to disassociate Kauffmann's incredible and horrible experiences as a hostage in Beirut from my appreciation of the book itself. Every piece of ennui, every flat, sad phrase seemed to take me back to the chair in which he was blindfolded and chained for three years. I think it would be impossible not to attribute some significance to his past, but it is something Kauffmann fails to address in any way at all. (It is mentioned only in passing on the book jacket.) What we find instead is a troubled man coming to terms with a troubled place. But here his insights aren't very deep. He seems utterly amazed that this place, so far away from anywhere, is still France. This is an glimpse into the Gallic mindset that perhaps only an Englishman could appreciate. He also feels very impressed with being there. He seems to pinch himself a lot. Wow, I am in Kerguelen! Apparently, it's windy. His attempts at a back story -- his attempts to show why this place has haunted him for so long are unconvincing and rather dull. He includes what history he could find about the place, but, sadly, there isn't so much. For an example of this type of writing at its finest, I would check out Bruce Chatwin's In Patagonia and Kevin Patterson's excellent The Water Inbetween. Both of these books come from similar emotional places, but engage the reader in more interesting and varied ways. 
A102OZZ31NALGU B00003XACV August 5, 2003 3 3 5.0 Extraordinary After listening to this music, Thomas Newman soon became my all-time favorite composer. He uses a different style and so many different sounds and rhythms than other composers. When you listen, you do not feel like you're watching a movie in your head or missing part of some message. This music stands alone. It is powerful and moving. It's emotional and fun. Your music collection is incomplete without this score. 
A102OZZ31NALGU B00005UWHH April 30, 2003 0 0 4.0 Classic Hans Zimmerman Well done score. I didn't care much for the movie. But the music creates a nice mood. It's nice just to listen to while working or playin' on the 'puter. There is a nice mix of the culture of where the story is based. 
A102OZZ31NALGU B000003DCU January 24, 2003 1 1 5.0 Energetic and fun. Billy Barber is an extremely talented keyboardist and a gifted composer. Each piece on the Lighthouse album is unique and enjoyable. This is a CD I was fortunate to have while growing up. I love listening to it today just as much as when I was younger. The music is fun, intelligent, uplifting and very spirited. 
A102P9UKBY9P75 B00001ZT4D September 14, 2005 6 6 3.0 A Fun Game Based on Supply and Demand I was first introduced to Settlers of Cataan on recommendation from an avid player of Civilizations. The object of this game is to colonize the continent of Cataan using roads and settlements. The settlements and upgraded cities give you points with the winner being the first person to 10 points. The board is a circular hexagonal board. Each hex (for the exception of the perimeter hexes which are water and deserts) produces 1 of 5 different resources. Settlements are placed at locations where the hex's meet and roads run along the hex edges. Each hexagon is given a number which will give the player one unit of that resource. Settlements are built using resources which are obtained by rolling 2 dice and then consulting the board. Wherever that number lies a resource is produced if your settlement/city lies on it's hexcorner. At it's core, this game is a practice in trading. Throughout the game the person who trades the most is able to generate enough resources to expand out by building additional raods and settlements. Seaports provide additional means of trade The strategy of this game is determining the supply and demand factors which will most likely occur and then placing your settlements in a manner which will be most advantageous to your victory. This is a fantastic game perfect for the family, friends and pretty much anyone who has an interest in very basic supply and demand economics. It has not only an entertaining component, but can serve as a great introduction into the foundations of economic principles. 
A102P9UKBY9P75 078691811X April 13, 2005 1 1 5.0 The Classic Fantasy Trilogy R. A. Salvatore can be credited with single handedly bringing The Forgotten Realms and Drizzt Do'Urden into the minds and hearts of fantasy lovers everywhere. Being one of his first serious works, The Icewind Dale trilogy is a fun and action packed story with it's strongest trait being the extraordinarily detailed characters that inhabit it's pages. The first book tells the tale of a community located in the ice filled north. These harsh conditions set the tone for a book filled with magical beings, dragons, and fantasy races of all kinds (namely dwarves, humans, elves, and dark elves). While the central conflict remains the defense of Ten Towns against a maddened wizard, what the story really focuses on is the central characters: Wulfgar the Barbarian, Drizzt the dark elf ranger, Bruenor the dwar, Catti-Brie the mage, and Regis the halfling. The second book whisks the main characters off to the warmer and more dangerous southern coasts along the Sea of Swords. Salvatore increases his boundaries and really fleshes out the world he is slowly creating. It is really in this book that the story begins to really focus on Drizzt Do'Urden: his past, his present, and his future. Some critics have stated that Salvatore focuses almost too much on this much-loved dark elf. I would tend to agree, but that does not mean that this wonderful character and his night-filled past isn't worth exploring. The concluding book in the trilogy remains (in my opinion) the least powerful of the three books, while introducing one of the more enjoyable villains who goes on to become a regular feature of future Salvatore books: Artemis Entreri. As with the other two books, you find yourself less and less caring about the overall story and just waiting for the time to come around when Drizzt and Artemis are going to square off. The work itself exemplifies what R.A. Salvatore is very good at: creating characters that are filled with emotions, experiences, and character that are put in situations where you learn more and more about them. What you find is that you could care less about the overall story and look forward to the interactions between these very diverse people as they interact (or sometimes are forced to interact) with each other. Overall, I recommend this book as a fun-filled summer read which is relatively light, but full of adventure. As the characters, especially Drizzt, hack and slash their way through hordes of undead, goblins, dragons and demons they endear themselves to you in a way where you want to pick up the next trilogy just to see where they will go next. In a way, these characters are the equivalent of fantasy superheroes and the story is almost a drawn out comic book in that the characters may find themselves tore apart, but they always manage to come back and save the day. The one discredit I will give this book is that it, along with The Dragonlance Chronicles, began the era of cookie-cutter fantasy books which now fill the shelves of numerous bookstores around the country. Dragonlance is particularly prone to this problem. That being the case you have to be very selective in your choosing a book set in either of these two realms as you never know the quality of the story you are about to read. With that in mind though, a rich world full of delightful characters await the reader who turns their mind onto The Icewind Dale Trilogy. 
A1031R8HD3E4GL B000AOVL8G October 23, 2005 0 0 4.0 Welcome Return Kings X took a break from their melodic side with their past few efforts...They are back to "old form" with Ogre Tones. This is not to say that I would rank this with "Gretchen Goes To Nebraska" or "Faith , Hope & Love" , but it is an excellent CD. Ty Tabor's beatlesque vocals once again comliment Doug Pinnick's funk/r&b rhythms...Standout tracks include "If", "Mudd","Sooner or Later" and "Alone"....I recommend fans of early Kings X to buy this one! 
A1031R8HD3E4GL B0000CDLA7 November 14, 2003 0 2 3.0 This Train's on a Different Course... Having been a long time Dream Theater fan, and Prog fan, I was initially very turned off by TOT. The melodies, strange time changes, intricate keyboard parts etc. , have been replaced with DARK brooding metal....With that said, TOT is not a bad CD, it is just NOT Dream Theater. John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy show off their talents at "lightening" speed. The problem here is that other Metal bands have been doing this for years (Metallica,Anthrax,Iron Maiden etc..) There are some standout tracks on TOT such as "As I Am", "Vacant"/"Stream of Consciousness" and "In The Name of GOD".Unfortunately, what lies in between is a lot of NOISE......I hope the next "train" that arrives contains the "old" DT...... 
A1031R8HD3E4GL B000050HV0 December 15, 2000 2 2 5.0 Melodic Madness! "The 7th Song" is a fantastic collection of Steve Vai's guitar ballads (the 7th track on his CD's). This offering is chock full of intensely emotional guitar ballads. For listeners who love early Joe Satriani (Vai's ex guitar teacher, ala "Surfing With The Alien")this will blow you away! Vai has as uncanny knack for delivering highly technical guitar elements in the guise of beautiful melody...Standout tracks include "For The Love Of God", "Windows To The Soul", "Tender Surrender", "Hand On The Heart" and the NEW "Melissa's Garden". This is a great "taste of Vai" for newcomers. 
A103KNDW8GN92L B00005JNYP August 7, 2005 3 7 4.0 T & A The Dukes Way! A motion picture mostly based on the television series, "The Dukes of Hazzard" contains a lot of what fans of the 1979-1985 original series have come to expect: savory redneck characters, all-out dragstrip car chases, sexy, waifish babes decked out in skimpy bikinis, & a whole lot of Southern exposure. The plot & storyline fits neatly into the movie's 1 hour & 45 minute time frame, but, if you're tuning in expecting to see your favorite original series stars make a personal appearance or just a mere 2-minute cameo, you'll sorely be in for a disappointment. With that qualm aside, let's focus on some of "...Hazzard"'s main players. The film's two main leads, Seann William Scott & Johnny Knoxville, who play our two heroes Bo & Luke Duke, fit nicely into their roles (including their tight blue jeans!). Scott & Knoxville couldn't have played their roles any better, plus, those Southern accents earn a passable grade of C+ at best. But, I have to admit there were stunt doubles handling the highly skilled, fast-paced driving. A word to the wise, kids; don't try these stunts at home. Jessica Simpson does a marvelous job of portraying the drop-dead-gorgeous Daisy Duke. For a singer, Simpson's acting isn't half-bad, & almost steals the show from the film's three main male leads, which brings me to Burt Reynolds' role of Boss Hogg. Although he's no Sorrell Booke, Reynolds' acting here isn't quite a cut above Booke's portrayal in the TV series, but is sort of unique in it's own subtle mannerism-ish way. What's missing in Burt's performance, is the ornery scowl Sorrell Booke brought to the TV screen, including an open-faced meanness that was second-to-none - right up there with ol' Ebenezer Scrooge & Sheriff Buford T. Justice (the latter being another Reynolds vehicle & nemesis, but that's sort of another story). Burt's quiet performance as Boss Hogg could go as passable at best, although that white suit he was sporting could have contained a couple more pillows at best! The Roscoe character (M.C. Gainey), was waaaay off center, & voiced rather monotone throughout the picture. No hawkey, southern cackle, no expressionism, no nothing. James Best's portrayal of Roscoe P. Coltrane in the series definitely wins hands down versus Gainey's one-dimensional characterization here. Please don't get me started on Enos here. The actor who portrayed him didn't remotely look anything like the Enos character portrayed by Sonny Shroyer in the original series. Lynda Carter's cameo was nice to see, albeit a brief one, nonetheless. But, the real star of the film would have to be Willie Nelson. As Uncle Jess, he pretty much has the physical presence & the mannerisms down to a tee. Nelson's performance is almost a dead-ringer for the Denver Pyle character from the series. To sum it all up, "The Dukes of Hazzard" will provide a lot of what the average viewer will pay to see in a motion picture, & will get an adequate amount of peachy-keen Georgia-type Southern exposure in the viewing process. This movie would have gotten a five-star rating easily, if series regulars Tom Wopat, John Schneider, Catherine Bach, James Best & Sonny Shroyer had gotten a place in the movie, even if it had been a mere two minute cameo appearance. Hence, the docking of one star. Still a good movie to waste a typical weekend day in seeing, nonetheless. 
A103KNDW8GN92L B0000033OZ August 28, 2002 2 2 4.0 ELP Spreads Its Wings On Debut After a brief stint with The Nice, King Crimson and Atomic Rooster, Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Carl Palmer were now ready to take flight, and achieved it in grand fashion on this, their self-titled 1970 debut release. The world would get a healthy dose of ELP's wholesome, technically sound progressive-rock artistries (on this and future ELP efforts), all of which are homogenically and proudly displayed on the opening track, the lone instrumental "The Barbarian". Lake's soaring buzz guitar starts this track off on its merry way, with Emerson and Palmer chiming in with a keyboard and drum clinic soon afterward. The musical tempo then spirals downward just a bit at the beginning of "Take A Pebble", with Lake adding a Crimson-esque touch to his soft, velvet-like vocal delivery. ELP displays an all-out musical assault on the ears on "Knife-Edge", as these three diverse and talented musicians pull out every musical variation neatly housed in their well-tuned arsenal, courtesy of Lake's rhythmic, bottom-heavy bass, Emerson's upscale keyboard/piano harmonies and Palmer's stormy, cutting-edge style drumming. Much of this same musical craftsmanship is carried over into the "Three Fates: Clotho/Lachesis/Atropos" suite, although both the lyrical and intrumental qualities ELP would present on future suites on following albums would appear to be a tad more developing and insightful ("Karn Evil #9" from the explosive "Brain Salad Surgery" being a prime example). The "Three Fates" suite is still very hook-laden, as it sports many different musical styles, with several artistic hooks to keep even the most die-hard ELP fanatic entertained for hours on end. "Tank" is yet another superb piece of explorative art from the group, and doesn't "tank" in the process. "Emerson Lake & Palmer" ends with the tediously poppy, yet enjoyable, "Lucky Man", ELP's first (and perhaps only) U.S. Top 40 hit single. This track goes off on its own unique veritable artistic tangent (courtesy of Emerson's keyboards and Moog synthesizer), which saves it from being a total commercial disaster (which it isn't). Overall, there's much pleasure to be had from ELP's debut, even though this soon-to-be supergroup would dig deeper into their creative progressive portfolio on their next release "Tarkus" and beyond. "Tarkus" would prove to be the effort that put Emerson, Lake and Palmer on the musical map, but, as for the case with their self-titled debut, ELP had to start somewhere, and what a beginning this release truly was, and still is! So, like the eagle on the cover, "fly" on down to your local retailer today, and pick this one up. Definitely worthy of having in your must-own CD collection! 
A103KNDW8GN92L B000002PD6 April 30, 2002 1 1 5.0 Live AND Well: What An Interesting Concept! Although "Live & Well" is a rather unique and dynamic work of art which contains ten tracks, it's actually two sides in one...no, make that two ALBUMS in one, being that the first five selections make up the "Live" part, while the latter half of this disc features studio cuts - the "Well" half. There's no comparing or contrasting both halves of this CD, as the live material and the studio material compliment each other quite nicely, and without any major flaws, too. The only minor flaw on the studio tracks which feature blues legend Al Kooper on piano, is his playing, although quite masterful, comes across as being barely audible for the most part. Kooper's piano digitry is somewhat drowned out by the heavy-bottom bass playing featured here, which is why a remastered version of "Live & Well" is so desperately needed, complete with bonus tracks. As for the upstanding compositions on display here, B.B. King is up to his usual guitar playing virtuosity, especially on the "Live" versions of "Don't Answer The Door" and "Sweet Little Angel". The lone "Live" instrumental, "My Mood", contains lots of soul-searching, power-driven down-to-earth chords. The studio tracks have a lot to offer as well. "The King of the Blues" really "Gets Down To Business", as he provides some down-home primo licks on the effervescent "I Want You So Bad", the utterly demanding "Get Off My Back Woman", as well as on the "run the gamut-like" studio instrumental "Friends". But, it is on "Why I Sing The Blues", where B.B. really cuts to the chase, as he gives his fans a major clue as to why he's in the business of performing in the first place (besides his mastery and his love of his "girl" Lucille). Besides the work of Al Kooper on the studio-based "Well" selections, Hugh McCracken provides some top-notch guitar licks as well. It is due to the musical talents which come to the forefront in grand form on "Live & Well", that makes it a must-have, must own CD, and is one title that every B.B. King fan definitely needs to add to their collection - no ifs, ands or buts about it!!! 
A103KNDW8GN92L B00000DRAM February 6, 2002 6 6 4.0 Life After Stealers Wheel... A few years after Gerry Rafferty scored two major and minor hits with "Stuck In The Middle With You" (1973) and "Star" (1974), as one-half of the Scottish musical duo Stealers Wheel, with Joe Egan, Rafferty went on to a moderately successful solo career overall (although he cut an inauspicious [solo] album prior to co-forming SW, the 1971 release "Can I Have My Money Back"). Most of his stateside successes came in the early part of his career, between 1977 and 1980. Gerry's biggest selling album of his career, the 1978 release "City To City", has a good representation amongst all the selections featured on "Right Down The Line: The Best Of Gerry Rafferty". Sax impresario Raphael Ravenscroft delivers a powerful solo on "Baker Street", which is the key ingredient that makes this selection really stand up and take notice. The other "City To City" hit singles - the major single "Right Down The Line" and the minor hit "Whatever's Written In Your Heart" are also worthy of praise, with the blues-like hooks of "RDTL" and the gospel embracings of "WWIYH". But, the marvelously composed standout tracks don't stop there, as "Right Down The Line..." also contains some up-tempo goodies as well - "Sleepwalking", which has some heart pulsating rhythms, although the lyrics are somewhat on the cheesy side, with both "Shipyard Town" and "A Dangerous Age" being somewhat authenticated with a Scottish/Keltic musical influence. Raphael Ravenscroft also appears on another track, "Bring It All Home", which has a bit of a barroom blues feel to it, with that sassy saxophone interspersed throughout. There's a nice, introspective soul-searching composition that appears on this best of compilation as well, titled "The Right Moment" - possibly the most overlooked hidden gem on this collection, and has a nice, melancholy ring to it, in both musical and lyrical areas. "The Garden Of England" has its strange and bewildering moments, but fits in here somehow, nevertheless. All in all, there's not one bad song on here, but there could have been some improvements, such as the record company could and should have included Rafferty's more noteworthy hits "Home And Dry" (also from "City To City") and "Days Gone Down", which would have solidified a five-star review. "Right Down The Line: The Best Of Gerry Rafferty" is still an outstanding body of compositional works, and thus belongs in every serious fan's CD library, Gerry Rafferty fan or not. 
A103KNDW8GN92L B000001EGC November 2, 2001 0 0 5.0 The Elton John-Bernie Taupin Connection "Madman Across The Water" is perhaps Elton John's and Bernie Taupin's most creative musical and lyrical output, when compared with their other stellar early '70's albums for a number of reasons. For instance, "MATW"'s two opening tracks, "Tiny Dancer" and "Levon", both display a vibrant orchestral fluidity (especially the latter selection), as well as a unique, melancholic autobiographical charm (moreso prevalent in "Levon"). "Tiny Dancer" was written about Taupin's girlfriend at the time, a dancer named Maxine Feibelman. What makes "Madman..." a musician's clinic, are the percussive guitar and mandolin skills, which are craftfully provided by the likes of drummer Roger Pope and axeman extraordinaire Davey Johnstone - whose talents on the mandolin are quite exceptional on the road-heavy "Holiday Inn". Johnstone would become a full-fledged member of The Elton John Band by the time EJ's next LP, "Honky Chateau", was released the following year in 1972. Adding to this standout array of musicianship, is guest Rick Wakeman, whose playing on a majority of "MATW"'s tracks is sometimes barely audible, and on selections such as "Razor Face", he pulls it off in spades. Wakeman would soon leave the Strawbs and join Yes after working on this album. Also introduced to the band are bassist Dee Murray and drummer Nigel Olsson, both of whom appear on one track, the impeccably overwraught "All The Nasties". Both Murray and Olsson would become prime-time EJ Band members also by the release of "Honky Chateau". The CD's title track is sure to give even the most casual Elton John fan "suspensful down your spine chills and thrills", courtesy of "Madman's..." intense lyrical and orchestral jinegar. EJ and BT both paint a rich, textured Native American cultural landscape and soundscape in "Indian Sunset", as if they realistically transported themselves back in time and dwelled amongst the natives (not bad for a couple of Brits, wouldn't you say?). The lyrics of "Rotten Peaches" would focus on the sad sack trial and tribulation nature found in a majority of Elton's and Bernie's musical and lyrical compositions in future albums as well. For these two songbirds, that is a very good thing, for fans of these two compositional wonders wouldn't have it any other way, including yours truly. "Goodbye" is a fitting end to the CD's macabre, storybook-like novella. "Madman Across The Water" is an absolute must for all die-hard Eltonians to have in their CD collection(s). Aren't you just "dying" to have this title in your Elton John library right about now? 
A103KNDW8GN92L B000002PE4 July 23, 2001 2 2 4.0 The first punk-rock album Of all the British Invasion groups to emerge in the '60's - The Animals, Herman's Hermits, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and others, no group brought together a unique sound and style quite like The Who. What made this group's sixties albums so omniprescent was that they were the first remnants of the punk era, which didn't emerge full scale until a decade later. "The Who Sings My Generation" has the punk seal of approval artistically etched into almost all of the songs. Keith Moon would soon become a household name in the annals of rock music notariety, and would carve his own musical niche with his inventive, over the top drum playing, in much the same style players such as Jimi Hendrix and Terry Kath (Chicago [Transit Authority] would soon bring to their guitar playing wizardries. Evidence of Moon's unorthodox drum intracacies is heard in the instrumental "The Ox", "La La La Lies" and "My Generation", and would soon blaze a trail for other drummers to follow, with the likes of John Bonham and Phil Collins, among others. The Who shows here they can stylize an R & B number with tremendous fashion, as in the soul-grabbing "Please, Please, Please". Since this album is considered by many to be the first punk album, "The Who Sings My Generation" would soon pave the way for a new generation of punk rockers a decade after its release. Another unique element which spices up a majority of the tracks displayed here are the rough, hard-edged and the soft, bluesy vocal musings of Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend, whose masterful, one-off guitar stylings pull this CD through with such brevity and sheer gusto. John Entwistle's bass-playing qualities complete an artistical, well-honed musical picture, which would make any hardcore punk fan pround to declare his allegiance to the genre. Now, if producer Shel Talmy would allow MCA to remaster this one of a kind gem, which is in need of the remaster treatment, to which The Who's other CD's in their catalog have received. Until then, The Who's many fans will just have to make do with this standout masterpiece, which has stood the test of time, even more than thirty-five years after its release. "The Who Sings My Generation" is definitely one CD for the ages, and belongs on every The Who fan's shopping list. 
A103KNDW8GN92L B0000032ZK July 10, 2001 7 8 4.0 The hits just keep on coming! Since there are so many good songs on "Super Hits of the '70's - Have A Nice Day Vol. 20", hitting the continuation button on your stereo is highly recommended for a number of reasons. Volume 20 of this 25 volume series spotlights the pop/Top 40 hits from 1976-'77. There are untimely classic ballads of the tear-jerker variety found in Peter McCann's "Do You Wanna Make Love" (released in the late summer of '77) and in Engelbert Humperdinck's "After The Lovin'" (released at the beginning of '77). Continuing through the ballads, Seals & Crofts feature one of their final chart hits from late summer '76 with the up close and personal "Get Closer", while Mac Davis's "Baby Don't Get Hooked On Me" predates this collection of hits by some four to five years, with a release date of 1972. A hits collection wouldn't be a hits collection without the smooth, mellow vocal stylings of Cliff Richard, whose ghoulish smash hit "Devil Woman", is featured in this wonderful array of mostly late '70's favorites. Of David Geddes' two 1975 chart hits titled "Run Joey Run" (which can be found on Vol. 15) and "The Last Game of the Season (A Blind Man In The Bleachers)", the former tune is just downright crude and horrible, while the latter track is warm and sentimental, and therefore, fits rather snuggily into this collection with ease. Boomer Castleman's "Judy Mae" is the only weak entry of the bunch, whose lyrics sound a bit too "Hatfields and McCoys"-ish to suit me. Los Angeles based trio Hot had their only hit titled "Angel In Your Arms", which shows up here, and is yet another delightful ballad. This wouldn't be a true '70's collection without at least one disco song - that being "Disco Duck (Part I)", provided in a wacky style that only Rick Dees And His Cast Of Idiots can bring to the disco table. One-hit wonders Smokie had a major hit with "Living Next Door To Alice" in early '77. "Alice" was written by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, both of whom went on to even bigger glory as songwriters in the late '70's/early '80's for such artists as Exile, Bonnie Tyler and others. Smokie frontman Chris Norman teamed up with Suzi Quatro on the later hit "Stumblin' In (found on Vol. 22). If you're into '50's nostalgia, there's Dean Friedman's "Ariel" to whet your appetite. If there is a best song on this CD, that honor should rightfully go to The Sanford/Townsend Band's one and only hit smash, the jazzy-bluesy "Smoke From A Distant Fire". With so many good songs to choose from in this stalwart collection of marvelous compositions, "Have A Nice Day Vol. 20" is one CD you'll definitely come back to time and again. If you're a completist, you'll need this one in your must have, must own collection. Keep in mind that each CD in this series has its own style of songs to suit different musical tastes, so it's not necessary to collect all 25 CD's. On that note, it is most wise to pick and choose your favorites as you go along. "Vol. 20" is a sure-fire winner! 
A103KNDW8GN92L 6303039456 June 7, 2001 0 3 5.0 Not just for kids! John Candy stars in a semi-dramatic role as Irv Blitzer, coach of the Jamaican Bobsled Team in "Cool Runnings". Doug E. Doug and Malik Yoba offer fine supporting roles as well, as Blitzer's hard to teach pupils about the complex winter sport of bobsledding. In order to pull this feat off, an at first reluctant Coach Blitzer must mold his Jamaican recruits by teaching them the basics of the sport. The results start out rather rockily, for the rugged, tropical Jamaican landscape has absolutely nothing to offer in the form of snow, cold and ice, which would allow these first time bumbling Olympic athletic hopefuls to gain some further insight on how to better prepare themselves for the tough road ahead. The hilly Jamaican terrain would soon serve a purpose here, as the sport of bobsledding requires much agility and speed necessary to navigate the many curves and slopes throughout the course. But, in order for these athletic hopefuls to accomplish their goal, they need to raise money for the trip to Canada and the 1988 Winter Olympic Games. Despite the necessary coddling courtesy of Coach Blitzer, who is unable to borrow the $20.000 from the local Olympic Committee that is needed to send the troops to Calgary. On to Plan B, where our future Olympic hopefuls attempt to raise the money on their own through donations, but are only able to scrape up less than $1000, well short of the money needed for the trip. Plan C turns out to be the charm, as one of the athletes, named Junior, receives a cash loan (obtained by him through a small white lie) from his wealthy father (who wholeheartedly objects to his son's amateurish career choice), plus Junior having to sell his car to cover the remaining cost of the trip. Now, the wheels are set in motion. As soon as the boys and their coach arrive in Calgary, they receive a rather harsh greeting, courtesy of the harsh, bitterly cold winter weather. Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug), Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) and Derice Bannock (Leon), are having great difficulty in adjusting to their new winter environment, while Coach Blitzer seems to feel at home in the whitewash (he ought to, being that John Candy's Canadian! - although in the film he's from the U.S., kinda ironic, huh?). Blitzer sees to it that his boys are not affected by the negative surroundings, not to mention the harsh reception by everyone from the International Olympic Committee to the other athletes. The coach gives the guys a strict training regimen to better prepare them for their qualifying run, which got off to a shaky start, eventually being the laughingstock of the Olympic Games. Well, as they say, practice makes perfect, as Coach Blitzer & Co. are off to try their nighttime practice qualifying run again, this time coming ever so closely to the one minute official qualifying time limit, but fall just short at finishing with a time of one minute, two seconds. The third time would be the charm, however, as the crew finished their final practice run before the real Olympic competition, finishing at under 1 minute (59.46 seconds, to be precise). Now, it's on to the real trials, where the Jamaicans come out of the gate slowly and unsurely, thus continually being mocked at by their adversaries. Coach Blitzer is proud of his team, nonetheless, so the guys go out and celebrate their somewhat major accomplishment, as a result of their second Olympic run. There's still more work to do, however, before the Jamaicans' third and final run, which is a must see. Many a viewer of "Cool Runnings", will be both happy and heartbroken upon seeing the spellbinding ending, which will teach chidren a very important life lesson and instill confidence in them at the same time. Adults will like it for many of the same reasons, including the harsh Canadian environs in which "Cool Runnings" was filmed. The warm stylings of the reggae music are also a perfect compliment to both the Jamaican and Canadian environs, as well as to the film's soundtrack. With the fact that this is also one of John Candy's final films, makes this feature a must see, must buy for the entire family. Don't miss out! 
A103KNDW8GN92L B0000032ZM April 27, 2001 11 12 4.0 A treasure trove of memorable late '70's hits "Super Hits of the '70's - Have A Nice Day Vol. 21" contains yet more of those '70's power-pop Top 40 tunes you've come to know and love. This collection focuses on the late '70's - specifically late 1977/early 1978. Ram Jam's "Black Betty" kicks things off into high gear, with an unmistakable Southern-rock, hard-edged flair. As the Autumn months of '77 rolled around, moviegoers hadn't quite gotten their fill of the box-office mega-flick "Star Wars", which was released in theaters earlier that summer, so a discofied rendition of John Williams' original score was released - this version by Meco titled "Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band", which hit the Billboard charts big-time and made it to number one, as well. The Los Angeles-based group Player reaped adequate rewards from their first single titled "Baby Come Back", released during early '78. Player's success was short-lived however, and saw just two more singles enter the charts during the course of the year, and disbanded soon afterward. The absolute worst song of all time appears on this collection - Meri Wilson's "Telephone Man". Whoever had the foresight to include this clutter here had to have been on battery acid, as it is just plain horrible and incredibly insipid - which is why "Have A Nice Day Vol. 21 gets four stars instead of five. Now that we've gotten that senseless, moronic "tune" out of the way, let us continue onward. Ex-Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne member Jay Ferguson, who had a hit with the former group and sang lead on the single "I've Got A Line On You" in the late '60's, contributes here with his only solo chart effort "Thunder Island", released in the Spring of '78. If it's wispy, sentimental ballads that you crave, there's Dan Hill's "Sometimes When We Touch", a major hit in both the U.S. and Canada also during the Spring of '78. For a howlingly good time, ghouls, ghosts and goblins will have a frightfully good time with Warren Zevon's "Werewolves Of London". Moviegoers in the Winter of '77/'78 will recognize ex-Bread frontman David Gates' "Goodbye Girl" from the movie of the same name, which was released in April of '78 after the motion picture's release. Wales's Bonnie Tyler had her first big hit with "It's A Heartache" during the Summer of '78, as well as did Michael Johnson with his hit - the melancholic tear jerker "Bluer Than Blue". Before Exile jumped the pop ship into country music waters, they hit it big with "Kiss You All Over", written by two of the group's members - Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, who became songwriters and mega-producers for other artists during the late '70's and early '80's. Finally, to round out this collection of chartbusters, there's Walter Egan's top twenty smash "Magnet And Steel", which also features backing vocals courtesy of Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. As far as "Telephone Man" is concerned, I felt Rhino could have utilized better singles for this collection from that era in its place, such as Dolly Parton's "Here You Come Again", or Firefall's "Just Remember I Love You" (both released in Autumn of '77), to name a few, although there are several other singles from this time period that could have definitely gotten the nod over "Telephone Man". Even though we're stuck with TM, "Have A Nice Day Vol. 21" is still a good arrangement of superbly crafted pop tunes to have in your CD collection at any rate. A must have for completeists of this 25 volume series. 
A103KNDW8GN92L B000002P49 January 8, 2001 3 5 5.0 The Original Skynyrd's Last Album "Street Survivors" is most likely Lynyrd Skynyrd's most memorable album, because of the tragic October 20th, 1977 plane crash, which took the lives of three of the legendary band's members. Killed in the crash were lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, backing vocalist Cassie Gaines and road manager Dean Kilpatrick. The other members were seriously injured, but eventually recovered. "Street Survivors" would eventually serve as a fitting tribute to the original lineup's music, and what a true last stand of a Southern rock gem it is, with delightful tracks such as "What's Your Name", "You Got That Right" and "That Smell", a tune that takes a rather obscure look at drug and alcohol abuse. Skynyrd's true Southern rock roots shine in "One More Time", while the other tracks keep the CD flowing through quite nicely. The CD also features both album covers: one on the front of the booklet showing the original cover with all seven members engulfed in flames, and the all black memorial cover with all seven members on the back of the booklet and on the CD's back cover. Since "Street Survivors" is the last "real pure" Lynyrd Skynyrd album, die-hard fans of this group will want to add this title to their must-have collection(s), nontheless. 
A103KNDW8GN92L B000002U9B December 18, 2000 11 13 5.0 Kenny Rogers:Master of Country Music! "Kenny Rogers-Twenty Greatest Hits" is sure to please both country music and adult contemporary music fans alike. For the country music purist, there are selections such as: "Lucille", "Daytime Friends", "Coward Of The County", "Love Lifted Me" and "Reuben James", to name a few. For the adult contemporary fan, these selections are guaranteed to warm your heart: "Lady", "Through The Years", "She Believes In Me" and "I Don't Need You" could make you the ultimate Kenny Rogers fan! If you like Kenny's singles hits here, then you're sure to love his duets featured in this ultimate Greatest Hits collection. Kenny teams up with top-notch country and pop music divas the late Dottie West (Til' I Can Make It On My Own), Kim Carnes (Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer) and Sheena Easton (in a remake of Bob Seger's classic hit "We've Got Tonight"). You'll also find KR's TV and motion picture hits "The Gambler" and "Love Will Turn You Around", from the movie "Six Pack". These are many of the hits featured in "Kenny Rogers-Twenty Greatest Hits". So what are you waiting for? Buy your copy today! 
A103KNDW8GN92L 0800104730 December 13, 2000 13 13 4.0 Almost as funny as "Silver Streak" "Stir Crazy" is Gene Wilder's and Richard Pryor's second film in which they starred together. Although this film contains many very funny scenes, the chemistry that Wilder and Pryor display here isn't as strong and cohesive as in their first film "Silver Streak", but is do-able. The scenes which slow this picture down are the rodeo-escape scenes toward the end of the film, and display very little life and are somewhat boring. The plot of "Stir Crazy", though, where Wilder and Pryor are framed for armed robbery and sent to prison, is quite amusing and hilarious, with the right amount of flavor and texture to grab my attention! The fact is, any movie starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, with the exception of "Another You", will command at least a four-star rating. Any die-hard fan(s) of these fine actors/performers will want to add "Stir Crazy" to their must-have collection(s). 
A103KNDW8GN92L B0000032N6 October 14, 2000 4 9 4.0 Mercy sakes alive, looks like we got us some hits! "Have A Nice Day-Volume 15" features a variety of radio-friendly hits from the mid-'70's. Here you will find the country-to-pop crossover smash "I'm Not Lisa", by Jessi Colter (who used to be married to country crooner Waylon Jennings), Hamilton, Joe Frank And Reynolds' second and final Top-40 number one hit "Fallin' In Love", African-reggae vibes in "Black Superman-Muhammad Ali", by one-hit wonders Johnny Wakelin And The Kinshasa Band, and the Australian group Jigsaw with one of their few hits to enter the American charts, "Sky High", to name a few. Truckers will get a kick out of C.W. McCall's CB craze song "Convoy", which inspired a hit movie of the same name. This collection of '70's songs just wouldn't be complete without the sugar-coated disco vibes of Hot Chocolate's "You Sexy Thing". "At Seventeen" by Janis Ian is just average, and Austin Roberts' "Rocky" is just plain boring. Dwight Twilley's "I'm On Fire" rocks the house down, so you better not crank this number up too loud, or your house will look like a pile of rubble! I found David Geddes' "Run Joey Run" to be quite asinine (in laymen's terms, that means stupid). For those of you into '50's nostalgia, there's Pete Wingfield's "Eighteen With A Bullet". "Saturday Night", by the Bay City Rollers, is just OK. Some of the great songs on this CD more than make up for the mediocre ones. Still a good buy. 
A103KNDW8GN92L 6304108869 September 29, 2000 7 7 5.0 What would you do with $300,000,000? Hmm...let's see...For starters, I would buy myself five or six mansions in different parts of the world, possibly start up a car collection, or perhaps take a few dozen trips around the world and deposit the rest in a bank account. The point is, "Brewster's Millions" is a delightful comedy that stars Richard Pryor as a down and out ex-professional baseball player who must spend thirty million dollars in thirty days. If he is successful, he'll inherit $300,000,000. Sounds easy, right? The catch is that Mr. Pryor must have no assets of any kind after the thirty days to obtain the money. John Candy co-stars as Pryor's buddy and is an "en route" benefactor to Pryor's real fortune. Stephen Collins also co-stars as an attorney who would like nothing more than to con Pryor out of his millions so he can obtain the fortune for his future firm Granville and Baxter. Pat Hingle does an outstanding job as the overseer of the conditions of Montgomery Brewster's (Pryor) great uncle's (Hume Cronyn) will. All this makes for a well-crafted, suspensful comedy. o do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of "Brewster's Millions" today. Chuck Fleming (Peter Jason), Action News! 
A103KNDW8GN92L B000002IJ2 September 23, 2000 0 0 3.0 Nice...but a little too techno-poppish "Invisible Touch", which came out in 1986, may have won a lot of praise for Genesis' experimentation with this advanced-technological array of songs. Needless to say, this CD didn't exactly bring out the hardcore Genesis fan in me, but there are a few good songs here. The masterpiece here is the lone instrumental "The Brazilian", which Tony Banks shows off his keyboard/synthesizer skills. Genesis fans will want to add this CD to their collection, nontheless. 
A103KNDW8GN92L 6304414145 September 14, 2000 3 4 5.0 This film is a must have! "Ransom", directed by Ron Howard, offers chilling performances by Mel Gibson, Gary Sinise and Rene Russo, all of whom are highly talented, seasoned professional actors. Donnie Wahlberg, Lili Taylor and Brawley Nolte make up a fine supporting cast as well. The kidnapping plot and storyline are well thought out and well scripted, and make for a wonderful suspense thriller from start to finish. This one's worth owning! 
A103KNDW8GN92L B000002J27 September 6, 2000 6 6 5.0 Collins' singing debut a smash "A Trick Of The Tail" marks Phil Collins debut as Genesis' full-time lead singer, replacing Peter Gabriel, who left the group a year earlier. Not only does Collins do a superb job on lead vocals, he is also a seasoned pro on the drums. Collins has a more than capable supporting cast in Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and Steve Hackett. Together, the talents of these four individuals reall shine on this CD. There are no standout track here, and each one is a classic. How can you go wrong with the explosion provided by "Dance On A Volcano?" "A Trick Of The Tail" contains an equally impressive ballad titled "Ripples", and "Robbery, Assault And Battery" has somewhat of a comical side. This CD also marks the first of a long line of pure instrumentals in "Los Endos", a rolicking, progressive piece of music. Please Buy this CD, along with the group's follow-up "Wind & Wuthering". Either or both of these CD's are a delight to have in your colection! 
A103KNDW8GN92L B000002674 September 5, 2000 3 3 4.0 A slice of techno-pop When I first listened to this CD, I was a little surprised Neil Diamond strayed pretty much from his usual "soft side" and went for a harder techno-pop sound here. This is not a bad CD to say the least, and many of the heavily synthesized tracks provide a welcomely refreshing change of pace in songs like the title track "Headed For The Future", "Stand Up For Love", and the Stevie Wonder penned "Lost In Hollywood", on which Stevie provides the keyboards. This CD also has its melancholy side with tracks like "The Man You Need" and "It Should Have Been Me", as well as sentimental tracks ("I'll See You On The Radio) Laura" and "Me Beside You". The techno-pop, synthesized sound is alone worth the price of this CD. Even true Diamond fans will want to add it to their collection. A must buy! 
A103KNDW8GN92L B000002QX0 June 15, 2000 2 2 5.0 An excellent work! This CD contains some untimely classics (Black And White, Pieces Of April) satire (My Old Kentucky Home) and rockers (Chained, Tulsa Turnaround). Love that line "when a man's gonna eat fried chicken he's gonna get greasy!" There's a nice ballad titled "Freedom For The Stallion", as well. I recommend you buy this CD. You will not be disappointed! 
A103KNDW8GN92L B00004SX3H February 25, 2003 2 2 5.0 Fripp and Crimson break musical ground once again! In the words of guitar master Robert Fripp: "King Crimson once again reinvents itself. We have a new wheel." Hence, the wheel contained in this, "The ConstruKction of Light" rolls through quite smoothly, and without any noticeable "squeaks", either! Crimson has never rocked harder, a fact to which all eleven numbers will attest. Speaking of reinventing, Adrian Belew does just that with his often-refined vocal stylings, which come through loud and clear on the opening "ProzaKc Blues". It is the catatonically disturbing and heart-pulsatingly descriptive musicianship of master bassist Trey Gunn and all over the boards drummer Pat Mastelotto which adds to the dark and ominous tone to all the selections here. Belew's depressing lyrics add the finishing touch to the chillingly deceptive theme which runs throughout this "construKctive" masterwork. Upon hearing Mastelotto's stormy, cutting-edge drumming technique and Gunn's sweet-science bass playing, as are strongpoints in one of the instrumentals featured in this "construKction", "Larks' Tongues In Aspic, Part IV", the question you'll ask yourself about the former is: "This guy was in Mr. Mister?!!?" Joining Crimson has matured Pat's musicianship, immensely. This is well documented into "Coda: I Have A Dream" as well, with Belew's garbled, fuzzy vocals wonderfully buried in the mix. Crimson shows they are not afraid to go out of the fire and "Into The Frying Pan" with spectacular and depth-defying precision. In summing up King Crimson's long history, which dates back to its humble beginnings to 1967, it is safe to say some of their works to a degree on paricular albums (ex: "In The Court of the Crimson King") are long-winded and hypnotically sleep-inducing (such as "The Dream and the Illusion" section of "Moonchild" from the above-listed title). None of these ingredients are contained in "The ConstruKction of Light", which makes for an eye and ear opening musical listening experience. Make this "...Oyster Soup, Kitchen Floor Wax Museum" odyssey your "pearl" by adding this "gem" to your essential (and concise) King Crimson collection today! 
A103PHKSEPT10R 0940160552 January 4, 2001 7 8 4.0 Still the best, but also read Schultz's King Philip's War This is the best and most unbiased history of King Philip's war. Leach wrote the book; Morrison only wrote the two-page introduction. Leach tends to be a little "politically correct" but in generally he gives us an unbiased history. This is an interesting book and I've just finished rereading after a 10-year gap. It is still interesting. This was an amazing war between Puritans, who were would poorly equipped in nearly every way, against Indians who would were born and raised in warfare. For many months the Whites lost virtually all the battles. King Philips' war was one of desperate sieges of tiny garrisons and ambushes of those Whites trying to rescue those besieged. Just when you think the Whites are about to get the upper hand, the Indians attack new targets and the Whites are losing again. The most amazing thing is that the colonists had not one English soldier or ship to help them. They raised and equipped their own little militia companies. Unlike some other Indian wars that only had a few battles, this little war had dozens if not hundreds of little battles. The Indian was as well armed with flintlocks, as was the White. In this war, the Indian was far superior in tactics and he was never beaten when he could fight his guerrilla style warfare. This was the Indians' last chance to push the White man into the sea. Providence (Rhode Island) was nearly destroyed and the Indian raided the towns adjacent to Boston. Town after town was destroyed. I think this book is a little superior to Schultz's "King Philip's War," which is a little bit too PC. But both are well worth reading. 
A103PHKSEPT10R 0805738657 March 22, 1999 39 51 5.0 Honest, Interesting, and Informative There have been dozens of poorly researched books written about the White nationalist movement in America, and "White Power, White Pride!" is the only exception. The other books are not objective and they just repeat the semi-truths and outright falsehoods that circulate in the controlled news media rather than doing original research, which is what Dobratz and Shanks-Meile did. This book is primarily descriptive. It tells the history of the "movement" and describes today's major groups and leaders, who they are, what they believe, and what they do. The authors give an unbiased account of the FBI's and AFT's wars against Whites -- Gordon Kahl, Ruby Ridge, and Bob Matthew's Silent Brotherhood -- as well as the FBI's illegal and underhanded war against the Klan and other White groups. It does have a few dry parts where these two professors describe how the movement fits into Sociology's theories. Dobratz and Shanks-Meile don't seem to understand that the White movement is a biological struggle for survival and not a sociological movement. Nevertheless (from my perspective as someone in the "movement"), I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the White movement. There is a wealth of interesting material in here for journalists, and no newsroom should be without a copy. 
A103U0Q3IKSXHE 0976670518 November 29, 2005 0 0 5.0 Paying it forward . . . I had the honor of working with Ole Carlson at a recent workshop. At first I didn't really connect Carlson with the book I had just finished reading prior to the workshop. About an hour into the meeting I realized that the speaker was advocating some of the very principles from the book that I had so heavily marked up and reread several times. What a delight! And what hard work - Carlson walks the talk, and he definitely put us through our paces. And this book will do the same for those who take the time to read it. Beneath the Armor is filled with straight forward talk about the leaders at the top of Business. At the end of each chapter is a review and a list of actions to take based on the information we just read. It is a practical, put it to work book for CEOs. Chapter titles give us an idea of the clarity this book will bring to the serious leader: 1. Be Authentic - it is easier to Remember; 2. Take Care of Yourself First - then others; 3. Lead the Organization - Let Other Manage it; 4. Value Resiliency over Brilliancy; 5. It is All About the People; 6. Understanding Your Numbers is Not Optional; and 7. Have a Well-Lubricated Reverse Gear. Written in deceptively easy and conversational style, each chapter turns out to be chock full of solid strategy and finishes with a call to action. Reading this book did in fact change the direction of my consultancy. More importantly, this book in conjunction with spending four days in a workshop with Ole Carlson changed my life - for the better. This is a must read for leaders and those who coach and/or consult with business leaders. To quote Mr. Carlson, "The message in this book comes from you and your peers and I am simply paying it forward." 
A103U0Q3IKSXHE 0375706771 April 5, 2000 32 33 4.0 Midwives - a story for our times. This is a book I couldn't put down. It is amazing how Mr. Bohjalian was able to put into writing the feelings of women during childbirth. Certainly it is difficult enough to express those feelings, but to do so as a man shows an incredible amount of compassion and understanding. A lesson to us all, I'm sure. This is a tightly written novel concerning a normally safe home birth gone terribly wrong, and how it affects the lives of all those involved. It twists and turns and leads the reader to wrong assumptions over and over again. At the same time it manages to bring forth the mystery and wonder of life, and especially the moment of birth. The novel is written from the point of view of the Midwife's daughter, who is, at the time of the writing, a doctor, specifically an OB/GYN. Armed with first hand knowledge as well as her mother's copious notes, Constance spins the story of her mother's passion for midwifery, devotion to her trade, and tragic loss of that love after the death of one of her mothers. The trial scenes are wonderfully exciting and maddening at the same time. But more important is the story of love and support in the Danforth family, though not without it's stress and misunderstandings. And Constance tells her own story of growing up and through the tragedy of the public trial, her mother's too close relationship with her lawyer, and her father's struggle to understand and support his wife. All in all, a wonderful book that surprised me a great deal. Thanks to my wife and our book club for getting me to read it. 
A103U0Q3IKSXHE 0345384563 March 25, 2005 11 11 4.0 Intolerance of monotheism I was not disappointed in this volume by Karen Armstrong, one of my favorite authors. It was interesting going back to an earlier book after reading her latest works. While this book is long and a bit tedious for a non-history buff such as I, it was definitely worth the effort. This is truly a challenging read. Armstrong covers a huge amount of history (about 4,000 years) with densely packed words over approximately 400 pages. The perspective is balanced with insights from many of the world religions and how they may have influenced each other or developed independently. While many of the world religions are mentioned, the focus is on "people of the book;" Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Armstrong points out that "Today we have become so familiar with the intolerance that has unfortunately been a characteristic of monotheism that we may not appreciate that this hostility toward other gods was a new religious attitude." Armstrong discusses the similarity of developing thought throughout the Muslim world as well as the Christian world and how they tracked through history. She declares that "Christian fundamentalists seem to have little regard for the loving compassion of Christ," and points out that "Muslim fundamentalists have toppled governments and either assassinated or threatened the enemies of Islam with the death penalty. Similarly, Jewish fundamentalists have settled in the Occupied Territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip with the avowed intention of driving out the Arab inhabitants, using force if necessary." She sees this type of religiosity as a retreat from God. All in all, after a careful and thoughtful reading of this excellent history of the all too human effort to define god, a person will find themselves understanding the sad state of affairs we see today in human spirituality. It's not a pretty picture, but one definitely worth contemplating. 
A103U0Q3IKSXHE 1400042216 July 18, 2004 8 11 4.0 Political decision maker's required reading . . . Why Liberals will win the battle for America is the subtitle for Mr. Reich's latest book. A month or so ago, I was privileged to hear him discuss this book and his findings at a very large gathering. The response to his presentation was one of support and encouragement. Yet, while certainly liberals come to hear Mr. Reich, I happen to know that there were many "conservatives" in the audience and they too were applauding. Why is that? What is the appeal to conservatives? I would like to think that the appeal is simply one of, well, REASON! It may also be that the old labels no longer apply to the average American. It may well be that Republicans, Democrats, Green Party, Libertarians, and those who decline to disclose any party affiliation all have come to understand that things are too complex for sound bites and that reason must prevail. They may be finally getting the message that we are all in the same boat together and so we must work together with respect and compassion. For those who embrace reason, compassion, and a sense of connectedness, this book will provide much with which to agree, and will provide provocative ideas with which we might reasonably disagree and debate. Reich certainly doesn't shy away from taking a position, regardless of who's toes he might crunch. For those who believe that globalization is killing jobs he has this message: "Every task that's repetitive-anything that can be done more cheaply by automated machinery or computer software or by a person laboring in a poor country-is no longer going to be done by Americans at American wages. Period." For those who would continue to ignore the growing separation of the haves and the have-nots, he has this message: "In America in the twenty-first century, real prosperity is shared prosperity. That's what we are losing rapidly, and that's why Radcons are wrong and their thinking is dangerously obsolete." Radcons? Yes, Mr. Reich is not above taking his shot at the Radical Conservatives he believes are creating a situation of further economic stratification and therefore internal strife in America. This book is definitely good reading for all of us, regardless of the label put on us and regardless of whether or not we agree with everything Mr. Reich has to say. The book is truly based on reason. I hope all political decision makers find the time to read "Reason, why Liberals will Win the Battle for America." It should be required reading for us all. 
A103U0Q3IKSXHE 0809117541 September 1, 2003 1 1 5.0 Just when the caterpillar gave up hope . . . Hope for the Flowers is a children's story with a moral that we adults should take to heart as well. We can't help but keep thinking about our own careers as Stripe, the caterpillar, struggles with his climb to the top of the heap. Once he gets there, he learns that there really isn't anything special to see or own. I won't spoil the story for you, but will remind you of the old adage that it is best to make sure that the ladder you're climbing is against the right building! I highly recommend this book to those with young children or who teach young children. Only because you might be embarrassed to purchase it for yourself and read it. So use a child as an excuse and learn how Stripe and Yellow finally get through the perils of climbing the heap. Simply a wonderful book. 
A103U0Q3IKSXHE 0761519661 April 22, 2003 43 47 4.0 The network is King . . . The New Professional makes clear the evolution of multilevel and direct marketing. Like many folks, I had a pretty dim view of the overly aggressive sales tactics and misleading meeting agendas that I ran into with many of the earlier direct marketing efforts. Now I see that things have changed for the better - much better! Inventory is not in your home, it's not in someone else's garage, it is at the distributor and easily obtained through the internet. Supply chain management is superb in these new companies. For example, King and Robinson provide statistics to show why direct marketing is a robust and very efficient model for introducing some products into the market place. And, they show why the type of person involved in network marketing today is truly a professional: "Of key interest, the research found 'successful (direct and network marketing) sales people have a communication style or social style that encourages the building of relationships with their customers . . . The most successful sales leaders have a combination of relationship and task orientation' (in their communication styles)." Network Marketing and multilevel marketing are synonymous terms. They are defined by a business model which pays commissions on multiple levels of the sales organization. Network Marketing/Selling differs from Direct Selling in that Network Marketing: 1. Focuses on relationships rather than on closing the sale or booking an order 2. Focuses on information sharing 3. Independent business owner (IBO) 4. Commissions on multiple levels of sales (not just retail of the IBO) The role of the network marketing channel is to accelerate the movement of products using the most efficient distribution technique: word-of-mouth communication. This is an excellent book to bring you up to date on the network marketing phenominon and to understand the new business models (yes, there are many). 
A103U0Q3IKSXHE 0062516876 March 24, 2002 1 1 3.0 A spiritual jouney to the top A book on loan from a friend who returned my DVD movie of Vertical Limit with this book as "interest on the loan." And what a payback! Throughout the whole book we are treated to not only a story of climbing a mountain, but we are given insight into a spiritual quest and a peek at the lives of the Sherpa people. The story starts out to chronicle the IMAX filming expedition of Everest in 1996 lead by David Breashers. And while that goal is accomplished, we also learn of the superstitions, faith, and spirituality of the Sherpa people. We learn too that the modern world has taken its toll on those people in the same way that it has affected most of our world. But Jamling Norgay tells us his own story as well. We learn of his lost faith as he studies here in the US and then how he regains respect for the religion of his youth as he prepares for the expedition. We are privileged to learn of the ritual offerings, and given insight into the "forecast" of the lamas. All of this is done in a spell-binding, can't put the book down way. An entertaining and informative read. 
A103U0Q3IKSXHE 0060629789 September 27, 2001 16 20 5.0 What would Jesus Do? I have read several of the Jesus Seminar series now and have many more on the shelf to read as well as books from some of the individual scholars. But what intrigues me about this volume is the cross reference work and foot notes that help me to better understand the context of the what Jesus did and what was done to him. After reading much of this volume, I can say that I was not disappointed in the thorough and logical way in which the case for the historical acts by and toward Jesus were developed. This book will find a prominent place on my reference shelf for those times when I need a detailed analysis to answer the question, "What would Jesus do?" A must have for any serious New Testament work. 
A103U0Q3IKSXHE 0944344771 April 19, 2001 23 28 5.0 Oh what I didn't know! When I was about one chapter into this book I stopped to wonder why it was called "remedial." As I continued to read, it dawned on me that this is a perfect title in that while a very broad range of topics relating to the history of Jesus, the Bible, the Church, and various forms of Christianity are covered, they are not covered in depth. Rather, Dr. Laughlin manages to give us enough information to make us stop and think and thirst for more. It would be easy to lapse into well deserved accolades over this book, but suffice it to say that it was exceedingly difficult to put it down and I found myself not able to read two other books at the same time as this one, as would be my normal custom. I can't help giving an excerpt that is, to me, an outstanding example of the clear and forthright prose from this scholar: "While the thorough going skepticism of many Unitarian-Universalist may be too radical for most Christians, it is quite clear that Christianity has taken a turn in that direction and will have to embrace the attitude of Liberalism in a major and deliberate way in order to survive, prosper, and maintain its relevancy in the Third Millennium. The modern scientific world view is simply too pervasive, productive, and compelling to ignore; and all of us reared in the West are so acculturated into it that we simply accept it as the way the world operates. Any religion -- Christian or otherwise -- that demands of its followers that they deny their senses and minds in order to believe, or that tries to shield them from the prevailing worldview, is doomed to anachronism, retrogression, and eventual oblivion." And there are many more worthwhile gems of wisdom and scholarly corrections to common misperceptions about the many different faces of Western Christianity. This book is logically organized, clearly documented with excellent exercises at the end of each chapter. It comes complete with wonderful bibliography and glossary of terms. It will take every lay-person with the curiosity to learn more about Christianity to the next level of understanding. My sincere wish is that so many Christians, and those of other religious paths, read and learn from this book that a grass roots movement to modernize this wonderful religion takes place. Simply a marvelous text. 
A104KYSJJZLWB4 B00006469K May 3, 2003 8 8 4.0 Decent "Don" at bargain price It takes a special kind of conductor to integrate the comedic and dramatic elements of Mozart's most Shakespearean opera. Georg Solti, unfortunately, is not that conductor. He takes a taut, driving view of the score which may be exciting to some listeners, but verges on the manic in my opinion. Zerlina and Masetto's entrance is so frantic that they sound like they're preparing for a debauched Roman orgy rather than a peasant wedding. There are, however, two performances here which give unalloyed pleasure: Margaret Price as Donna Anna and Lucia Popp as Zerlina. Both are among the top recorded interpreters of their roles. Price's silvery, vibrant soprano moves effortlessly through Anna's high tessitura, always beautifully controlled and dramatically alert. There are no squally high notes or misjudged attacks - only Sutherland on the Giulini set is in Price's class. Popp has a fuller voice than is often heard in Zerlina's music, (sopranos like Sciutti and Gueden sound tiny by comparison) but it pays off in the nuances and inflections she puts into the music. She is both alluring and innocent at the same time. Luckily, we get to hear her in even more of Zerlina's music than usual, as the duet with Leporello, "Per queste tue manine" is included. Sylvia Sass is dramatically potent and can float a lovely messa di voce, but she is a little woolly for Elvira - her best work has always been in Verdi. Stuart Burrows as Ottavio sings beautifully, but fades into the background dramatically (although this is more the fault of the role itself than anything Burrows does). The final touch of individuality is all he lacks to be in the front rank of Ottavios. Kurt Moll's Commendatore is fine, but the other low voices disappoint. Gabriel Bacquier and Alfred Sramek (Leporello and Masetto respectively) sing the notes but don't do much more than that. Bernd Weikl is a frustrating Don - at times his voice is beautiful, but rarely does he allow himself a chance to simply sing. Like Solti's conducting, Weikl pushes through the music, perhaps to indicate the Don's doomed character, but it is impossible to believe this man is a successful seducer. Moments where he should ooze charm and suavity, such as "La ci darem" and the serenade, sound effortful and blatant (a pity, as Popp is exquisite in the duet). When everything is considered, I wouldn't want to be without this set for the superb performances of Price and Popp, and while Burrows, Moll, and Sass hold up their end of the show well, this can't be recommended as a first choice, although it could make a viable second choice to a favorite version. Try the Giulini or Krips recordings to hear a more cohesive reading of Mozart's masterpiece. (Readers should be advised that this recording comes with a libretto that is accessible only through a CD-ROM drive) 
A104KYSJJZLWB4 1578900115 September 29, 2000 18 18 3.0 A fine production marred by cuts The Brent-Walker series is currently the only complete (except for "Utopia, Limited" and "The Grand Duke") video set of Gilbert and Sullivan operas available. And, as far as I can tell, this is the only version of "Yeomen of the Guard" available on video in the U. S. This is the "serious" Gilbert and Sullivan, the closest thing to a grand opera the pair would ever do. If, like me, you have viewed the entire Brent-Walker series, you'll know that this production relies less on cutesy camera tricks and more on characterization and a real sense of the opera's purpose. The costumes and sets are really lovely, and the acting is very good, considering that many of the cast are singers before they are actors. Particular mention must be made of Alfred Marks as a likable Wilfred and Elizabeth Gale as a sympathetic Elsie (which is no mean feat; I consider Elsie the least sympathetic herione in the G & S canon). Pride of place, however, must go to Joel Grey's Jack Point, a stunning portrayal. I know there are those who disagree with me (I read one review that called him "dull as dishwater") but I find Grey a wonderful Point. He shouldn't be, of course -- he plays the part with an American accent and is a high tenor rather than the baritone the role calls for. However, the accent helps to mark Point as an outsider, and Grey has no problem with the lower end of his range. He really plays the role with a sense of the bitterness underneath the jester's facade, without alienating the affection of the audience. Jack Point is the pivotal part in this piece; depending on how the actor chooses to portray him, "Yeomen" can end up being a light operetta or a dark opera. Here, it is most decidedly the latter. Grey is especially moving in the final scene as well -- if he doesn't break your heart, you really must be a cynic. My review has been positive thus far, so why only three stars? Alas, the video is marred by the excision of no fewer than six entire numbers, as well as the opening verse of Phoebe's spinning song. Some of the most famous songs are gone -- both of Fairfax's arias as well as the quartets "When a Wooer goes a-wooing" and "Strange adventure." The decision for the elimination of these numbers is inexplicable. Apparently some of them were filmed and shown on the BBC broadcast, but no video version contains them. There is missing dialogue as well, most notably the scene between Elsie and the disguised Fairfax and the scene when Dame Carruthers discovers Sergeant Meryll's secret. Presumably these cuts were made so that the piece would fit into the two-hour time slot alotted to the other videos, but if so, that is a poor reason. So enjoy this video for what is there: costumes, sets, performances (especially Grey), but make sure you have a good recording handy so you don't have to do without the missing music. 
A104KYSJJZLWB4 B00000K4FQ February 16, 2000 11 11 5.0 High quality and captivating characterizations While it may be cliche, the old maxim rings true here: they just don't make them like this anymore. True, this set has its drawbacks, but a performance like this makes any such quibbles easy to forget. Firstly, mention must be made of the exceptional cast assembled here: virtually everyone is excellent. Pride of place must go to Elisabeth Grummer's excellent Hansel. While this is a part normally assumed by mezzos, Grummer's lovely soprano has enough weight in the lower range to present no problems with the low tessitura. The higher-lying passages are, predictably, no problem for her. Her voice remains radiantly beautiful throughout, and her characterization is sweetly boyish without being cloying (a trap many interpreters of these roles fall into). Elisabeth Schwarzkopf is a singer whose recordings continue to fascinate decades after they were made. Casting her as Gretel is an unusual choice (she normally took on slightly weightier roles -- she and Grummer, in fact, sang many of the same parts) and while she has to work to sound childlike, her way with the text is unmatched by any recorded Gretel. Her minx-like teasing of Hansel or her gauzy wonder at the appearance of the gingerbread house are just two notable examples. She also sings her Act 2 opening solo with a hushed innocence: for once, Gretel actually sounds like she's singing a folk tune to herself. The rest of the cast is quite good, if without the obvious excellence of the two leads. Else Schurhoff's Witch is fine; she really sounds like an old crone, but manages to sound frighteningly imposing when casting her spell. Maria von Ilsovay and Josef Metternich are both good, and Anny Felbermayer's soft-grained, childlike tone is right-on for her otherworldly assignments. She is marginally better as the Dew Fairy. What really sets the entire cast apart, however, is their scrupulous attention to the text and the interplay between characters. Everyone seems to be listening to each other, and that concentration and involvement really shines through. The sound, particularly in this remastered version, is excellent: not a digital sonic spectacular, true, but you'll probably forget you're listening to a mono recording. I'm not crazy about Herbert von Karajan's conducting in this piece. The loftier sections are really wonderful, but the lighter moments lack the propulsion and fleetness to really sweep us along (the awakening scene seemed interminable here). For the best recording of Hansel and Gretel, I'd recommend the Kurt Eichorn recording with Helen Donath and Anna Moffo. It also contains the best Sandman, Dew Fairy, and Witch (Christa Ludwig) on records. But if you have room for another classic recording, don't pass this one up. 
A104KYSJJZLWB4 B000000SQY December 3, 1999 8 8 5.0 An underrated set When this set was first released a couple of years ago, I hesitated in purchasing it because of the mostly negative reviews it received. I should stop listening to the critics. Carlo Rizzi's recordings of "La Traviata" and "Rigoletto" are both highly enjoyable and well conducted. This one is no exception -- Rizzi leads a spirited, engaging performance that nicely balances Verdi's lyricism and drama, never trying to smooth over parts that other conductors do because of their perceived "vulgarity." The cast is quite good, certainly much better than critics have given them credit for. Richard Leech sings with heady beauty and handsome tone; forget Cura and Alagna, he outclasses both of them. Vladimir Chernov does here what he excels at, namely, spinning out a rich, velvety voice, and singing with an authority that is quite compelling. The mezzo, Elena Zaremba, is a bit gusty and not ideally steady, but her dark, Russian, contralto-like tones are right on for Ulrica. Maria Bayo is a charming Oscar, with clean, sharp coloratura and without a trace of acidity in the voice. She is my favorite Oscar on records. Which brings us to the Amelia of Michele Crider. Judging by the harsh reviews she has received, one would expect an large, unwieldy, undersupported voice of limited dramatic expression. How unjust that verdict is can be heard by listening to her first aria, "Ma dall' arido stelo divulsa." Crider is dramatically alive and possesses a warm, rich spinto soprano: brilliant and blazing at the top, full and creamy at the middle, strong and steady at the bottom. She can sing with clarion power or spin a high pianissimo line reminiscent of Caballe. Critics have not been kind (I cannot understand why), but I for one would like to hear more from Ms. Crider. All in all, this is an engaging and highly enjoyable performance of "Ballo," perhaps not the best available, but one to which I will frequently return. 
A104KYSJJZLWB4 B000003LNT November 25, 1999 8 9 5.0 Another feather in Opera Rara's cap This installment in Opera Rara's "Hundred Years of Italian Opera" project again reveals a treasure trove of lovely melody and high operatic drama. The examples are well-chosen and really lovely, making one wonder at their neglect. One can almost hear history in the making, as these composers push the boundaries of musico-dramatic conventions. Listen, for example, to the excerpt from Mercadante's "Amleto," a Italian version of "Hamlet" which plays fast and loose with Shakespeare but is marvelous on a musical level. Mercadante includes whistling piccolos in the orchestration, which sound eerily like human screams, a truly bone-chilling effect. I was reminded of the "Dies Irae" of Verdi's Requiem. There is also a lovely aria a due from "Rosmonda" by Coccia, sung deliciously by Yvonne Kenny and Diana Montague. Kenny, who is featured prominently in this set, has lost some of the ease of her highest notes but sings with a beautiful line and an alertness to the dramatic situation. Other singers include Nuccia Focile, Della Jones, Bruce Ford, and Alistair Miles. An essential set for the lover of bel canto and for those who enjoy discovering (unjustly) forgotten works. 
A104KYSJJZLWB4 B000002W40 October 16, 1999 6 6 5.0 The version to start with Everyone who loves musicals (I feel sorry for people who don't) should have at least one recording of the "King and I" with Yul Brynner. This is the best one available. Not only one of the most complete recordings of the "King and I" (all that's missing is some underscoring and the "Small House of Uncle Thomas"), it also has one of the best casts assembled. Brynner is fine, the lung cancer which killed him in 1985 very much NOT in evidence in this '77 recording. Constance Towers is a terrific Anna, and she most certainly CAN act. Her "Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?" betters Gertrude Lawrence. Hye-Young Choi is my favorite Lady Thiang, floating her descant in "Western People Funny" better than anyone else. Martin Vidnovic and June Angela are an appealing pair of lovers, and the two boys roles are sung with energy. A treat for lovers of musicals, Rodgers & Hammerstein, and "The King and I." 
A104VHIMHTA3V9 B00005KG65 July 8, 2002 9 9 5.0 Straight From The Holler This is the best country album released in 2001 that I know of. For years, Patty Loveless has made terrific albums. On "Mountain Soul", Loveless harks back to the acoustic, no percussion, bluegrass music she grew up with. Get this album and just sit and listen to the edgy dobros, crashing mandolins, the haunting fiddles, and of course, Patty's heartfelt voice singing those insightfull lyrics. Three tracks that particularly stand out for me are *Out of Control Raging Fire*,*You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive*, a descriptive saga, and a song that Patty wrote herself, *Sounds of Loneliness*. Ricky Skaggs and Travis Tritt lend their voices and instrumental abilities and Emory Gordy's production is right on. There is not one song on here that falls short of being enjoyable. Patty seems to be well on her way to becoming a lengend. Recommended! thank you 
A104VHIMHTA3V9 B000002PDW April 8, 2002 2 2 5.0 Guitar Town "Guitar Town" is essentially a roots rock album with a heartland, hillbilly twist. Steve Earle wrote six of the ten tracks, and cowrote the other four. His voice cuts through the listeners ears, giving you chills. From start to finish, the record is filled with outstanding songs that you'll never forget. As a songwriter, Earle uses razor sharp lyrics, particularly noticable on the title track: 'Everybody told me you can't get far on thirty-seven dollars and a Jap guitar.' He wrote that song after arguing with his girlfriend on the telephone while he was out on the road doing concerts! *Fearless Heart* is a fantastic rock ballad--watch for the spine-tingling guitar solo. Earle brings in jangly guitars on tracks like *Gettin' Tough* and *Goodbye's All We Got Left* and also includes some hard, natural country on songs like the bouncy *Think it Over*, the working-class *Hillbilly Highway*, and the acoustic *My Old Friend the Blues*. *Someday* is the best cut of the record. This wonderfull storytelling song includes a beautifull electric guitar solo after the second chorus, and a timeless hammered-chord acoustic strum. Steve closes out the album with the smooth *Little Rock 'n Roller* and the mandolin-drenched *Down The Road*. Steve Earle delivers each and every song with all the confidence and conviction of the long-time veteran he was when this recording was released. Using studio musicians rather than his band seems to be the only flaw, but the remarkable high quality of the songs overcomes that. Definitely an essential recording for any alternative country/roots rock music fan. Thank You! 
A104Y042UJ1ERG 0804113505 August 28, 2001 1 1 4.0 Complex and moving I have read and re-read this book. I have also recommended it to others, and everyone has liked it! The characterizations are so good, and the ending is quietly hopeful. The reader can really enjoy Muriel and Brimm as they confront how they have dealt with their dark childhood and try to grow beyond it, even as they face Brimm's death. I really like the way they struggle to acknowledge painful events and learn from them -- but still not let themselves be completely defined by them. The murder mystery -- I really haven't been able to grasp how that ties in with the rest of the story; it seems tacked on and out of tempo with a self-exploratory novel, but it does fit in with the emotional timbre of the book. Also, involvement in the mystery does give Muriel a chance to be active in the present and to impact her community in a positive way, as she contributes to finding the serial killer. 
A104Z3S8I1EA7E 0072225351 March 1, 2004 15 16 5.0 I think it's a great book Let me begin by saying that I'm the author, so let's get that out of the way. I'm posting here to point out that the book has a tremendous amount of support materials that have never been advertised. Each of my books has a support page containing a current list of errata, downloadable files (completed exercises from the book), extra links to extra materials I have written and my email address in the event you have problems. I also run a series of online classes so that if you would like to learn with me in a more structured setting, you can do that also. You can access those materials via this link http://www.johnsmiley.com/books.htm I should also say that this book isn't for everyone---and you can read through some of the other reviews posted here to see why and why not. I wrote this book for beginner level programmers, and the book is written in a unique style. You (and I) can thank the now defunct Wrox Publishing house for the style of the book that some people absolutely love and others (primarily hotshot programmers with lots of experience) hate. The book is written as if you are participating in an actual classroom---many people, particularly those learning on their own or in an Independent study setting find comforting. My thanks to the many people who have written to me to tell me how much they've enjoyed my books and how they have helped them achieve their goals of learning to program. John Smiley 
A104ZYDRF17XWV 0745629040 November 2, 2005 16 19 1.0 Callinicos presents the argument from the "eat your cake and have it too" crowd. Alex Callinicos presents argument from the "eat your cake and have it too" crowd. While critical of neo-Liberals, he argues from the same wrong premise, the notion that you can tie the hands of the producers of the world without throttling production. His chief complaint is not that Capitalism doesn't produce, nor that Capitalism doesn't improve the standard of living for everyone. Rather, Capitalism improves the lives of the poor less than it improves the lives of the rich. This only makes sense if you think that there's another way to go. Callinicos cannot, and despite attempts, does not, make this case. No one can. With each turn of the page, I cannot help shouting, within the confines of my own critical mind, "but Capitalism is the best (and only) way to do it!" The "second way", socialism/communism/fascism doesn't work. And the "third way" is just a mix of the power of the first with the poison of the second. I recommend Dr. Andrew Bernstein's The Capitalist Manifesto as antidote. 
A10587XDOY3OR0 B000003RUV December 13, 2005 1 3 5.0 Out of left field I'd never heard of Faust before a few months ago. I'd purchased a Flaming Lips compilation that featured "It's a Bit of a Pain" as one of the songs, and decided to buy the parent album. Based on the sound of the song, I was guessing it was made in the last few years. It sounded very modern. But, no. It was made in 1973? That's crazy. So were the rest of the songs on the album: a weird mix of synth-punk, pop, and rolling, ambient tunes. What makes it stand out from the electronic/synth experimentation of its day is its amazingly mature, spare use of the computer. The synth elements aren't wielded in a "gee whiz" showcase manner, they just blend in with the traditional instruments (guitar, drums) to create a whole greater than the sum of its parts. True, there are some points where a song will degrade into shrill, sample showcase, but on the whole the sound is very modern. Subtle things, like the vocal shifting on "It's a Bit of a Pain" stand out to me as a precient technique for 1973. The melodies are all quite capable, too. Even little throwaway bridges in their longer songs are memorable. I can see why they never hit the bigtime, though. While certain songs are radio friendly, they refused to bury their apparent love of free-form, angular, reptitive sound experimentation. I don't see a lot of people listening to "Krautrock" from beginning to end. It's just too unfamiliar. That's their loss. It's just my cup of tea. 
A10587XDOY3OR0 B000000OVP August 13, 2002 2 12 3.0 The slide begins Alright... Weezer's first album was really good. They had a bunch of great songs, and the sound was new. This has a similar sound (not that new anymore) and a *few* good songs. The melodies and energy aren't as memorable. Of course, I could just be getting older, and less appreciative of this kind of music, but I don't find myself playing this disc all that much. When you play this disc in the background, only a few songs catch your attention. I'll probably burn some of the songs I do like onto a mix CD and put it back on the shelf. Dare I say "one trick pony?" 
A105B8V248S2WH 1570629579 August 9, 2003 4 9 5.0 The Demise of the Lord of Form! I read the book in college, and then again last year. I just reread the introduction and recieved the answer I've been looking for the last 3 years. The blockage is the creation of the form. This of course is the idea of he imageless (read formless) creator. That's all you need epending on where you are. This is similar to the Ashlagian idea of 'Mati v'lo Mati' (to reach and not to reach) or as Trungpa says "not too tight, not too loose. To loose, we don't get anywhere (no desire) to tight, we create a form ( an idol). I know buddhists meditate in fornt of a form, but you should ask them about that! 
A105B8V248S2WH B00004Z4RP December 5, 2002 2 3 4.0 A Hamlet for My Generation Ok. I admit it. I was a virgin. I was in Blockbuster and having never read or seen Hamlet I decided to be literary. And I was completely blown away!! It was one of the most enjoyable movie watching experiences of recent memory. I identified completely with Ethan Hawke as Hamlet, and the whole cast (except for Bill Murray). This version of Hamlet is perfect for anyone who has been a college slacker since the 70's and has felt the psychological and philosophical dilemma's that that place in our society engenders. The twin joys of this version are 1) the transcendent beauty of Shakespeare's language; and 2) the univerisality of Hamlet's struggles, which transcends the generations. It may not be for Hamlet scholars, but this one was done for us, and if your one of us, you will enjoy it. 
A105E427BB6J65 0399145990 September 9, 2002 1 1 3.0 Not impressed.. I like Alice Hoffman as a writer, and this book certainly had the potential to be a pot boiler. Great characters, nice magical references, but it appears Alice got to a certain page and decided to wrap it up. No ryhme, no reason. The plot did not deserve this ending. I'm left feeling very unfulfilled. I'm not even certain of the reason for the name of the book, let alone why one of the better characters is killed off early on and we're not ever given a satisfactory reason. And then other characters appear but don't seem to stay around of have any purpose, like Sean Byers. And Betsy running away with Abe???? The pharmacist suddenly discussing everything with his wife. This isn't the result of magic, but lack of imagination maybe? None of the actions or character/plotline prepares the reader for the way Alice wraps up a tidy little ending, unfit for the great beginning. Quite a let down. Did Alice run out of steam on this one? I won't give up on Hoffman, but this was not her best effort. 
A105E427BB6J65 0312976275 September 23, 2001 0 0 4.0 What an imaginative suspense writer! Janet Evanovich's series with Steph Plum just keeps getting more and more hilarious and fun! Janet has the ability to draw characters like few other suspense thriller writers of her genre. I particularly enjoy the fact that they don't have perfect hair or leap over tall buildings in a single bound, but instead they find themselves in ridiculous situations that bring them the humanity and commonality that is so frequently missing in suspense novels. There is none of the perfect chisled characters who are wise beyond belief. But instead, we get Plum, her granny, her sexual desires, her cousin Vinnie, and failed attempts that make for great reading escapes and enjoyable entertainment. Be careful not to read this one in a public place because you'll find yourself bursting out loud with laughter and either someone will wrestle it away from you or they'll clear extra space for you. Who cares! Enjoy this "hot" sexy read and then get on to the next one. 
A105E427BB6J65 0440205190 January 10, 2001 6 7 4.0 Slam-dunk! While I had some trouble first getting into the book due to the myriad of characters, I liked the plot concept, so I perservered. I was not disappointed. Once I was able to get all the characters straight, this was non-stop action with an ending that delivered! The characters were believeable and not so glam damn perfect as to be boring. Even the romance angle was well-written. Hats off to JC Pollock for a tightly written suspenseful gripping trip through an often written about genre! I will look for more of Pollock's work as this book was entertaining, complicated, and intelligent. Much better than a Clancy novel!! Kudos Pollock! 
A105E427BB6J65 0446358576 November 18, 2000 5 5 4.0 Compelling Drama! Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite authors, and he did not disappoint with this thriller. Unlike many authors, DeMille is not a formulaic writer and each book covers a diverse topic requiring intense research. His acumen for finely drawn characters and breath-holding suspense are evident in Cathedral. Although not as good as Charm School or Word of Honor, still this is worth reading. Keep 'em coming Nelson. 
A105GWGM7PDAI2 B00004YKDQ September 5, 2002 10 10 5.0 Great Case I was so anxious to get a camera case I almost bought a generic case for my S200 from Best Buy. Good thing I waited to buy this case, as it is far superior to any generic case I could have bought. This case is the perfect size for my Elph, it does add size to the camera, making it harder to get in your pocket, but the belt clip works great, so its hardly ever a problem. Good color for the case, and the front pocket holds enough to help out when you need another battery or flash card. The strap still comes out of one of the sides of the case, so you can still use it. Not a case to protect from the elements, but it will protect from impacts VERY well. For it's price, less than the generic cases, and its great fit and quality, I would most definatly buy this case again if my current one were to ever wear out or become lost. 
A105GWGM7PDAI2 B00004TRD8 May 13, 2002 0 1 5.0 Great Movie, Great Special Features Now, I don't actually know if this is the Ultimate Edition, since the preview picture has the cover of the Special Edition, the one with almost no special features. The Ultimate Edition I bought at Fye, at a slightly higher cost, but I knew it was the right edition. It has T2 on it in metal foil. There are so many hidden extras and special features, and the menus themselves kept me occupied for about a half hour. I recommend this movie to anyone. ANYONE. 
A105S56ODHGJEK B000051Y2U June 15, 2001 3 6 4.0 Real nice album, one of the best of the year On his solo debut, Sticky Fingaz brings forth a solid collection of tracks, meshed into a real nice storyline. From beginning to end, the album suffers from very few weak points. State vs. Kirk Jones features an all-star cast, which creates the perfect courtroom setting on a bangin track, helping to elevate the album's storyline. Other noteworthy tracks include Come On, Money Talks, and the poignant Sister I'm Sorry. The one real weak point the album has is on What If I Was White, an awful track featuring an unfunny cameo by Eminem. Other than that, "Black Trash (The Autobiography Of Kirk Jones)" is a bangin album from start to finish. Sticky's charisma and delivery are at the usual peak we've come to expect from him. And the production for the most part is top-notch. If you're a fan of good, solid hip-hop, this album should be in your collection. 
A105S56ODHGJEK 6300249964 May 19, 2001 0 1 5.0 You'll be rolling on the floor This movie is a classic, one of the best comedies in the last 20 years. Nicholas Cage delivers with one of his best performances, and Holly Hunter turns in a good performance as well. This is one every movie lover should own, and every casual movie viewer should at least rent and enjoy. 
A105S56ODHGJEK B000002TWQ February 11, 2001 1 2 5.0 A classic. "Doe Or Die" definitely qualifies as a certified classic. From beginning to end: the nicely-crafted beats, the vivid lyrics. This album packs a major punch. Tracks like Gimme Yours, Sugar Hill, and Mo Money Mo Murder (Homicide) are great, but the album's highlight is the Pete Rock-produced Rather Unique. This track is a masterpiece, plain and simple. One of the greatest tracks ever recorded. If you dont have this album, buy it NOW. 
A105S56ODHGJEK B00004SW9U October 5, 2000 4 7 2.0 Say "Blah"..... What do you get when a washed-up basketball player makes one last effort towards stardom? A mediocre stint in the CBA. What do you get when an MC wannabe makes one last run towards the top? Albums like this--full of mediocrity. Master P had his time in the sun, and that time is now over. The spotlight has been taken by a new Down-South bling-blingin label. They'll enjoy their few years on top, and then the spotlight will be passed again. You see, stuff like this works in cycles. You'll have a certain gimmick: in this case, bouncy, club beats and braggadocio rhymes. That gimmick will be perfected by a group of MCs, who will rise to the top of the ladder, only to be overtaken by somebody else. Now you see what has happened with No Limit. It started with the last TRU album, which came out around the same time Juvenile's "400 Degreez" was blowing up nationally. You could see the wheels turning at that time. Then No Limit fell completely off the map for almost a year, releasing very little while Cash Money dropped platinum selling albums seemingly every month. Then we come to the big anticipation moment--the 504 Boyz album. It was supposed to bring No Limit back on top. Master P, Mystikal, & Silkk were supposed to hit us with a gem proving they aint fell off one bit. The day comes, and judgement is passed. Wobble Wobble, a recycled track, blows up the scene for a hot minute, but then drops off playlists about as fast as you can say "UUUUUGGGGGHHHHHH.' People begin to realize: wasn't this album originally advertised as Master P & Mystikal? But yet, Mystikal is on a total of about 1 minute of the album. The Wobble Wobble video comes out--mysteriously missing Mystikal's presence. And then the news: Mystikal has left No Limit, yet another in a long line of top-notch artists to jump ship (Fiend, Big Ed, Mr. Serv-On, Snoop, among others). And then maybe the biggest joke of the album: this "thug" named Krazy who garnered much of the album's spotlight. There have been some bad Tupac rip-offs, but this man is the worst. Voice, flow, right down to phrases, he tries his hardest and succeeds in biting Pac to no end. A complete disgrace and laughing-stock of a rapper, who Master P apparantly thinks the public will grow to love as "Pac reborn"..... By now, you should get the point. This album is complete garbage. The one track on here that is worth any of your ear's time may be I Can Tell, a smooth R&B joint. But even that drips of No Limit cornyness. In short, the album's last two tracks almost say it perfectly: "NO LIMIT--SAY BLAH." 
A105S56ODHGJEK B00001IVOH June 15, 2000 3 4 5.0 Production MASTERPIECE On his solo debut, Pete Rock enlisted an all-star cast of guests to spit over some of the best work from PR to date. "Half Man, Half Amazin" features a lighter-than-usual Method Man trading verses with PR over a classic beat. "Respect Mine" features the ever slept-on O.C. over yet another classic PR beat. "Tha Game" featuring Raekwon, Prodigy, & Ghostface is just ridiculous. Absolutely unreal. NY's heavy-hitters spittin over another great beat. Ghost really tears that one apart with his energetic verse. "Take Your Time" is a beautiful slow-jam featuring Loose Ends. "Da Two" is a reunion track of sorts, as we hear the familiar voice of C.L. Smooth over yes, yet another classic PR beat. "Verbal Murder 2" is just sick. Everything about it, the beat, & the lyrics courtesy of Noreaga, Common, & the late Big Pun. "Strange Fruit" features a different kind of beat from PR, but Sticky Fingaz really shines on that track. The album may have been even better (if that's possible) if it featured less of PR on the mic, but even his less than stellar mic skills are made up for by his UNMATCHED work behind the boards. What more could you ask for in an album than some of hip-hop's best rappers flowin over beats courtesy of hip-hop's best producer? BUY THIS ALBUM! 
A105S56ODHGJEK B00000IFT2 May 1, 2000 1 1 4.0 Slick Rick re-enters the rap game with a nice album There's no doubt about it, Slick Rick was an old-school genius in the late 80's. Tracks like "The Show," "Children's Story," and "La Di Da Di," among others, were classics. But his last two albums, 94's "Behind Bars" and 91's "The Ruler's Back," weren't that good. Fast-forward to last year, and the Ruler's out from behind bars. Question was, could MC Rickey D, ten years past his prime, still put out a bangin album? The answer---a resounding YES. With production from Clark Kent, Grease, S&S, TrackMasters, and more, "The Art Of Storytelling" offers a wide range of fresh beats which compliment Rick's flow. The best track on the album is "2 Way Street," which features a tight beat from the Superman producer, and Rick's storytelling at it's best. "Memories" finds Rick reminiscing about back in the day, while "Adults Only" finds him pondering about the back door. The guest appearances are plentiful, but most are awefully short. The best collabos find Rick teaming up with Big Boi of Outkast on "Street Talkin," and Raekwon on the up-tempo "Frozen." All in all, it's safe to say this time the ruler's back for real. 
A105S56ODHGJEK B0000064SN March 2, 2000 10 10 5.0 Not as good as Family Scriptures, but still tight..... This is the second installment of the Mo Thugs family. Their first album, "Family Scriptures," is a brilliantly constructed MASTERPIECE. This album is very good, but not a masterpiece. Standout trax on here include "Mighty Mighty Warrior," "Mighty Mo Thug" (by the EXTREMELY slept-on Souljah Boy), "All Good" (despite the played-out term, this is a nice upbeat track), "U Don't Own Me" (although it starts to drag slightly, still a nice track), and "Otherside." "Riot" by Flesh Bone is a well-constructed track showcasing his slept-on skills. "Ain't Said No Names" is Krayzie Bone's solo. Although it's nowhere near as good as "Mo Murder" (his solo on Family Scriptures), it's still a nice track. The only trax I really could've done without on here are "Believe" (despite what Krayzie might say, these guys are not the next Jackson 5), and "The Queen," which features the whiny-voiced Thug Queen. She has upped her skills noticeably since this, but on here she was a major ear-bleed. Also, Powder ruins "Ghetto Cowboy," a track that could've been classic without his ten seconds of nonsense. In the end, this album is definitely a worthy buy. If you don't already have Family Scriptures, buy that NOW, then if you have some cash left over, pick this up. You most likely won't be disappointed. 
A105S56ODHGJEK 0060392991 December 7, 1999 1 1 5.0 Mankind delivers his biggest hit yet Mankind.....One of the greatest wrestlers of all time. Mick Foley.....One of the greatest writers of all time? OK, maybe I wouldn't go that far, but "Have a Nice Day" is a great read, all 500+pages of it. The humor ("He looked at me as if I'd just farted in church" is one example) is great throughout. The stories NEVER get boring. You'll pick it up and a couple hours later you won't even realize you're already half way through it--IT IS THAT GOOD. A must read if you're a wrestling fan, a recommended read even if you're not. 
A105YVLAZNYQUU B00004L8DJ October 17, 2005 4 4 5.0 What is wrong with you?! If you don't like this album, then you are not a real Pantera fan. I read someone complaining that this album is too heavy or something? WTF? Are you insane? If you want lame ass melodies and wimp music then go elsewhere. This album freaking kicks in you in head the second it begins, and doesn't let up until the last fade out. It is 100% aggression. All the songs rule and they all have fantastic riffs and vocals. No awful nu-metal crap and no ballads. Listening to this album makes my heart skip and it makes me want to fight - which is exactly what it should do. Pantera should be proud of 3 things: 1. Their albums got HEAVIER with each successive release. This is almost unheard of considering how many metal bands sell-out, wimp out or change styles. 2. Pantera leaves a legacy of pure metal, and this last album stands up perhaps the best work of their careers. 3. They never compromised or sold-out. Period. Sadly, Dimebag is gone but he will always be the soul of one of the most powerful bands to ever exist. RIP Darrell 
A105YVLAZNYQUU 074348343X February 14, 2005 6 7 5.0 The Dirt can wash off Tommy Lee takes us into his mind and world in this entertaining read. The format is fantastic, the stories are cool, and the bottom line is that Tommy comes off looking like a pretty decent guy. Towards the end of the DIRT, Tommy was looking pretty wimpy and weak - but this book dispels that notion pretty quickly. An emotional ride and very enjoyable to read - in fact I read it in about 5 hrs in one sitting. Definitely recommended 
A105YVLAZNYQUU B000002KDO November 11, 2004 1 1 5.0 Mind Blowing WOW - to date Sabbath created the heaviest 2 albums ever made and you think to yourself - where do they go from here? Well the answer becomes sickeningly obvious soon enough - they create an even more powerful sound and attitude. Are you kidding me? Right from the first seconds of `Sweet Leaf' - Sabbath show the world they are the innovators of the heaviest sound ever. The first 2 albums were metal and all - but they were blues based and Sabbath was still finding themselves. On this 3rd outing - the heavens opened and out poured the heaviest blobs of doom imaginable. Pure timeless boundless heaviness. Every second of this album is perfect. Inventors of stoner metal, doom metal, heavy metal - every metal. Sabbath is beyond the shackles of mankind on this album - they have progressed to some other-worldy existence of perfection. 
A105YVLAZNYQUU B000000HSX March 1, 2004 2 2 5.0 A secret treasure Fast, hardcore, metal, unique: These 4 elements make up the amazing concotion know as Kinghorse. Basically a relentless battery of anger with occasional melodic expressions. I bought this album the month it was released and immediately loved it. Memorable riffs and lyrics with a splash of hardcore make this a metal feast for the ears. I think this album is too intense for most people 'cause everyone I know hates it except me. I still listen to this record when I want something unique to kick me awake. This album puts the current music scene to shame. Sadly, Kinghorse didn't last long enough to make other albums but this record will always be a powerful stab of emotion. Kinghorse is one of the most unique bands I have ever heard. 
A106016KSI0YQ 0060548932 May 10, 2006 0 0 3.0 The best hope is that it's a transitional novel in a series Gregory Maguire's complex and dark revisionist telling of the life and avdentures of the Wicked QWitch of the West, WICKED, is something of a contemporary classic: more than just a reexamination of the imaginative worlds of L. Frank Baum, it's a very toughminded philosophical and political novel brilliantly told (and it improves in the re-reading). He has been beleaguered with requests for a sequel since the first novel's release, but unfortunately this follow-up, chronicling the further adventures in Oz of the Wicked Witch's possible heir, Liir, following the death of Elphaba and the departure from Oz of both the Wizard and Dorothy, doesn't seem to have much of a point to it. Even darker and more cynical than its predecessor, SON OF A WITCH seems a re-telling of the Waste-Land myth, with Liir acting as Parsifal to the Amfortas of the Winkie Princess Nastoya; but there seems to be little point to his actions, and the book suffers greatly from the fact that it touches much more tangentially on Baum's Oz books than its predecessor did. Though Tip and Mobi (and her four-horned cow) and the Hungry Tiger make the briefest of appearances, Maguire's book seems to make little sense when read against the events of THE MARVELOUS LAND OF OZ--which makes the whole revisionist project seem a bit pointless. But the tale does showcase Maguire's bracing philosophical cynicism and his strong narrative drive.The novel does seem to position itself open for another sequel at its ending, so we can hope that there will be more to come that will make sense out of what is a promising but disappointing follow-up to the excellent WICKED. 
A106016KSI0YQ 1590170105 August 20, 2004 2 3 5.0 A beautiful mind in a beautiful book Mary McCarthy is one of the most important American thinkers of the twentieth century, and she was at the heart of everything in the New York worlds of politics and letters. This superb collection of her essays shows her at her shrewdest, on subjects ranging from Eugene O'Neill to fashion magazines to Portugal to society and political figures. Famous for her unrelentingly flinty lordliness (memorably and mercilessly caricatured in Randall Jarrell's PICTURES FROM AN INSTITUTION), she can be savage in her reviews. When her stinging rebukes are deserved, as in her famous withering critique of Salinger's FRANNY AND ZOOEY, they're a delight, but even when you feel they're unwarranted or off-target they're still instructive and illuminating, and are always written with incredible elegance and eloquence. We want the best of the best critics to show, more than anything, a point of view, which McCarthy undoubtedly does: a point of view that is Europhilic, intelligent, self-important, funny, biting, and exceptionally articulate. This collection is an absolutely beautiful hardcover edition from NYRB that is as delightful to the touch as to the eye. It is an extremely worthy investment. 
A106016KSI0YQ B0001US6CI July 7, 2004 2 3 3.0 Fascinating if a bit aimless The problem with biopics is that in the real world events happen to people here and there. There is rarely a driving narrative to real people's people's lives. So you watch something like THE REAGANS fascinated by the detail (especially in its portrayal of the Reagan children trying to cope with their closed-off parents), but there's nothing to really be learned from the whole narrative. The Reagans meet and get married, have children; Ronnie runs for governor and then for the presidency four times (twice successfully); he gets shot in office and nearly undone by Iran/Contra, and then they go back to California. That's it. This miniseries was based on a book about the First Ladies of the US, so Nancy of course figures heavily into it. Judy Davis, inarguably one of the greatest actors living today, would seem born to play the ironwilled Nancy, and she approaches her part with a great deal of intelligence and makes Nancy seem enormously sympathetic even at her most imperious to her husband's staff or at her most firebreating to her children. She even gets to do a musical number, with great panache (Nancy's famous rendition of "Second-Hand Rose" for the Gridiron club), and she is allowed one exceptionally poignant scene (her meeting with her senile mother at a retirement home in the mid 80s). James Brolin fares less well: he looks very much like Reagan, and has the mannerisms and the voice down pat (he's even as good a mimic as President Reagan reportedly was), but he does not project the needed vitality. The Reagan children are well portrayed--lonely and needy Michael, upbeat Maureen, angry Patti (Zoie Palmer, in a particularly fine and furious small performance) and practical Ron Jr.--,but you feel they often get shunted off from the main narrative just as they apparently did in real life from their parents' all-consuming love relationship and political ambition. Republicans were furious before this miniseries aired about its antipathy towards the Reagans' politics, but the only real points it scores against the Reagan administration is in its willful obliviousness to the AIDS crisis. 
A106016KSI0YQ B0001US600 May 20, 2004 1 2 5.0 The single best ballet movie ever Pairing the singular vision of Guy Maddin with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet's production of "Dracula" was sheer genius: "Dracula," with its emphasis on the advent of modernity and corporeal corruption and repressed sexuality, is the ideal vehicle for Maddin's peculiar talents. What's more, using ballet dancers allowed him the opportunity to make a completely silent film (scored only with excerpts from Mahler's first and second symphonies). The results are stunning: this film has the most beautiful cinematography of any I've seen in years, the performances are superb, and Maddin even allows his trademark campy humor to creep into the titles (though not so much that it becomes annoying). The most beautiful sequences are danced in Lucy Westenra's mansion near the beginning, but the only thing is spectacular. 
A106016KSI0YQ 6304018959 January 17, 2004 22 23 5.0 A masterpiece encompassing many kingdoms The Kingdom is the name of a gargantuan decaying hosital in Copenhagen where this amazing Lars von Trier Gothic television miniseries is set. of course, the title also refers to the kingdom of Denmark (in the staff meeting room where many scenes take place, the portraits of Queen Margrethe and her consort are prominently displayed), for which the hospital is a metaphor, and for the kingdom of society in general. And, as von Trier explains in his charming afterwords to the episodes, it also refers to the kingdom of the imagination itself. The miniseries works on all these levels. It's a quirky, incredibly atmospheric study of the hospital centering upon the discovery of the ghost of a girl murdered 75 years previously on the same site haunting the hospital, and it revolves around a giant cast of dozens of memorable characters, all of whom are intensely sympathetic even though they're pretty miserable human beings. The three at the core of the story are a malingerer, the septuagenarian medium Mrs. Drusse, obsessed with discovering the story behind a ghost; a blackmailer, the young and sexy Dr. Hook; and his nemesis in the neurology department, the jaw-droppingly arrogant brain surgeon Dr. Helmer, who had to take this job in Denmark (which he loathes) after being cast out of a job in his native Sweden under suspicion of plagiarism. Although the Gothic aspects to the story are beautifully brought out by the labyrinthine deserted basement hallways of the hospital and Von Trier's gorgeous sepia-tinted cinemtography, like all the best ghost stories the ghosts here serve as metaphors for what's wrong with the state of society in general. The miniseries is an amazingly funny satire on the dilapidated Danish health care system, and the film's funniest moments involve the attempts of the neurology department's manager, the marvelously manipulative and passive-aggressive Professor Moesgaard, to implement a hilariously inane PR campaign called "Operation Morning Air" that involves (among other things) having the neurosurgeons cheerfully sing introductions to one another at staff meetings. The series has often been compared to "Twin Peaks," but it's probably even better. Like the Lynch series it does a marvelous job of conveying atmosphere, but it is deeper and more carefully engineered and imagined. Though there are moments that sag (including the disastrous idea of having Dr. Helmer visit Haiti near the end, which jarringly breaks the miniseries' adherence otherwise to the Aristotelean unities by and large), as a whole it is a genuine masterpiece. It is one of the richest works for television ever made. 
A106016KSI0YQ 067972883X December 19, 2003 5 8 3.0 Stacks its deck too unfairly Welty's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is largely told in the third person through the observations of its heroine, Laurel McKelva Hand, the daughter of a prominent and wealthy smalltown Mississippi judge who comes to New Orleans to help her father who must see a doctor for an eye affliction. On hand is the judge's second wife, the silly and vulgar Fay, whom Laurel and the doctor basically ignore. When the father unexpectedly dies, Laurel (who is older than Fay) must return to the smalltown with her stepmother for his funeral. The reasons for Welty's popularity with THE NEW YORKER editorial board are much in evidence: the story is told subtly and in small pieces, and accrues a remarkable level of hospital and genteel smalltown detail as it proceeds. Its measured rhythms are the best thing this novel has going for it. Unfortunately, it seems to proceed too much along the lines of a contest between discreet Southern gentility and refinement (embodied in the quiet and grieiving Laurel) and no-'count Southern lower-class vulgarity (championed by Fay and her obnoxious Texas relatives). Although Laurel comes to realize why her father's late-life optimism explains why he married Fay, Welty doesn't really allow Fay any sort of appeal to the reader at all, and so you finish the novel thinking how much *nicer* everything would have been had the judge never married her. (At least Tennessee Williams allowed Stanley Kowalski animal magnetism.) The novel seems too much on the side of delicacy , especially given that Welty's own fine feelings are so manifest in her method of telling of the story--though paradoxically some overobvious symbols (a carved boat, a breadboard, the judge's degenerating eye) weigh things down a bit much. The work is most interesting at the end, when Laurel must confront some truths about her real mother's final illness which complicate the overly schematic family alignments in some welcome ways. 
A106016KSI0YQ 0140088172 November 14, 2003 1 1 4.0 A great central conceit and a lively cast This is the most famous of the Gervase Fen mysteries Edmund Crispin wrote in the early half of the century, and its exceptionally fastmoving and funny. Fen is an Oxford don, so much of the fun of the work depends upon the characters constantly debating the literary merits of different authors (a Janeite and a Lawrence fan feature into the plot, Fen is paged once as "Mr. T. S. Eliot," and Joyce and Rabelais are dissed as unreadable). The novel begins with a doozy of a puzzle (a poet-friend of Fen's stumbles late at night into a toystore and discovers a dead body, and then the next day the body is gone and the toyshop has vanished--and no one can remember anything other than a grocer's on the site), but it unfortunately the plot becomes a bit cheesy as it wears on (too much attention is given to the "locked room" aspect of the mystery, and some of the stuff with Edmund Lear seems unnecessarily complicated). Still, the characters are superb and very much in the Dorothy Sayers mode, and the climax on a runaway carrousel is not only exciting but indisputibly the inspiration for STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. This does date as mysteries go, but the pleausre is in discovering what used to be exciting reading sixty years ago. 
A106016KSI0YQ B000002OJP September 24, 2003 2 2 4.0 Jerry Herman's finest score This show probably represents Jerry Herman's best work, even though (heartbreakingly) MACK AND MABEL wasn't a success in Broadway. There are a few weak songs ("Hundreds of Girls," for example), but otherwise the score is marvelous, and offers two beautiful songs which have since become cabaret standards: Mack Sennett's "I Won't Send Roses" and Mabel Normand's lovely melancholy "Time Heals Everything." Robert Preston is very fine as Mack Sennett, but the show's real sensation is Bernadette Peters as Mabel Normand. This was the role that first got her really noticed, and she's astonishing in all the many and very differing songs Mabel gets to sing--including my own favorite song from the show, the marvelously exuberant "Look What Happened to Mabel." Lisa Kirk, the original Lois Lane from KISS ME KATE, is also a knockout in her big number, "Big Time." 
A106016KSI0YQ B00006FHZD August 5, 2003 6 9 4.0 Markedly overcomes a centrally miscast role Gine McKee's being miscast as Irene Heron Forsyte is the greatest puzzle of this otherwise superb television adaption revisiting of Galsworthy's masterpiece of a wealthy family making the transition from the Victorian to the modern era. Although she looks splendidly chic and soigne in her costumes as Soames's trophy wife (she seems at times consciously to evoke Sargent's "Madame X"), she looks utterly unconvincing in her early scenes as a young unmarried girl who would capture Soames's attentions despite her relative poverty. Moreover, though she tries her best, she's just not up to the demands of the role, which requires her to be enigmatic (which she can manage) but also incredibly sympathetic (which she cannot). Otherwise this revisitation of the BBC miniseries which launched "Masterpiece Theatre" in 1969 is superb from beginning to end. The writers, Stephen Mallatratt and jan McVerry, did magnificent work in expanding Galsworthy's text, adding beautifully done scenes (such as Young Jolyon's heartbreaking leavetaking of his unloved first wife, Frances) that are only background material in the original source material. The extremely gifted actor Damian Lewis serves as the linchpin figure of the cast as the "man of property" Soames Fosyte, baffled by his violent passion for Irene and her refusal to reciprocate his affections, but the entire magnificent cast is a kind of "who's who" of BBC productions from years past, adding to the sense of accumulated history in the material. Special mention should be made of Joanna David (from the late Seventies adaptation of REBECCA) as Irene's pushing yet vulnerable stepmother; Judy Campbell (NANNY) as the formidable senior member of the Forsytes, Aunt Ann; the delightful Wendy Craig (NANNY, BUTTERFLIES) as the gossipy Aunt Juley; Corin Redgrave (PERSUASION) as the complex and dignified Old Jolyon; and especially Amanda Root (PERSUASION) as the increasingly wearied Winifred. The amazing performances of this ensemble--and the terrific production values-- make you eventually forget the weakness of McKee's miscasting. 
A106016KSI0YQ 6304843267 May 30, 2003 8 8 4.0 So bad it's brilliant AIRPORT 75 must have the least believable premise of any major Hollywood release that wasn't straight science fiction: a small private plane crashes into the cockpit of a giant 747 en route to Salt Lake City, and all the flight crew members are either killed outright or incapacitated as a result. So a stewardess (Karen Black, as bewitchingly crosseyed as ever) has to come into the remains of the damaged cockpit (which, despite the fact that it has a giant gaping hole in it, still manages to retain Black within it and do little more to her then make her chilly) and steer the plane to Salt Lake until Charlton Heston can be dropped by helicopter into the hole in the cockpit. The premise was so outrageous even at the time that it quickly spawned two exceptionally memorable parodies: "Disaster 75" on THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and AIRPLANE! (for which it was one of the primary sources of inspiration). But the original itself is so jawdroppingly strange it remains almsot beyond parody. The passengers are played by a series of Borscht Belt comedians like Sid Caesar and Jerry Stiller and Norman Fell, with the notable exceptions of a singing nun (Helen Reddy), a young girl with serious health problems (Linda Blair), and, most memorably, Gloria Swanson (as herself). The other stewardesses keep wandering in to the damaged cockpit to be comforted by Karen Black, who one would think has enough problems as it is. Even if you can get beyond these thing, you find yourself fascinated by the questions the film's astonishingly bizarre details propose, such as why the airline's logo is so ugly and why its color scheme (bright red with violet and fuchsia accents!) is so hideous. 
A106016KSI0YQ 078323502X March 14, 2006 0 0 5.0 "There have been... developments since he came to me" Much like CASABLANCA or CITIZEN KANE, it is almost impossible to see THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN completely fresh because so much of our popular culture today always refers back to it already. Like those other two films even the first time you see James Whale's most celebrated film you know the lines and the situations almost before they happen because the film has had such a resonance for our culture. As the documentary that accompanies this DVD, "She's Alive!," points out, almost everything about the film was serendipitous, from the superb cast, the great make-up and art direction, the extremely witty script, and the oddly perverse spirit in which the director approached this sequel to 1931's FRANKENSTEIN. Boris Karloff greatly deepens his most celebrated role by emphasizing the creature's alienation and loneliness, but the film belongs in the end to Ernest Thesiger, unforgettable as the camp and decadent Dr. Pretorius, and of course most of all to Elsa Lanchester doing double duty as Mary Shelley and as the title role. She appears for less than five minutes in the entirety of the film, but yet she walks away with the film entirely: who can forget her uncannily pixillated movements as the Bride, suggesting she should never have been brought to life, or her great shriek of horror when she meets her groom? This is in the end more of a comedy than a horror film, but it more than meets the promise of its predecessor (and enlarges and deepens the first film's meanings). 
A106016KSI0YQ 0060987103 February 26, 2003 5 7 5.0 An astonishing and sophisticated fantasia on L. Frank Baum Most of the disappointed reviews of Maguire's masterwork come from people expecting this book to be something it is not--to be somehow more like the 1939 movie THE WIZARD OF OZ, or like the 14 L. Frank Baum Oz books. Maguire's novel is like neither in tone, though it was certainly inspired by both, and uses as its coordinates the Oz mythology. Maguire's Oz is very thoroughly research-based on the Oz books and yet it is much darker and more sophisticated than Baum's Oz: Maguire manages to invent complex religious, political, and sexual-social systems for his version of Baum's wonderland. The novel ingeniously uses details and unanswered questions from the previous Oz books (why are the silver shoes so desirable? how did the two witch-sisters come to be rulers in the East and the West? what was the Good Witch of the North doing in Munchkinland, in the East, when Dorothy arrived?) and along the way presents a variety of deeply involving characters: Galinda, a Gillikin beauty will grow up to be the Good Witch of the North (Maguire tantalizingly never explains how Glinda will end up in the South at the end of Dorothy's jorney in a different guise); Nessarose, the armless and fanatically religious Eminence of the East; and, at the book's center, the marvelously complex and empathetic Elphaba, who will become the both the Witch of the West and Wicked by the novel's end. You're best off reading this book if you read the Baum books when you were younger, but you're also best off understanding they're not going to be quite the same. Maguire's is a rich, deep philosophical novel about the nature of evil and of governing systems, as well as a very funny and absorbing adventure story. It deserves to be the cult classic it has become. 
A106016KSI0YQ B00000JMQE January 6, 2003 18 19 5.0 A brilliant work--but for adults, not children The great film editor walter Murch got the chance in the early Eighties to make a spectacular film compressing the first two sequels to THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ, THE MAGICAL LAND OF OZ and OZMA OF OZ, as a tribute to the Baum books he loved. The film was a popular flop, given that almost everyone who took their children to it expected it to be a sequel to the famous M-G-M film version of 1939. (In Murch's version, there are no songs and the carryover characters from the first film--Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Lion---look like the original illustrations of them by John Neill and W. W. Denslow rather than the way they were portrayed in the 1939 film.) But the film has endured as a cult classic, a master of the film art's tribute to the books and illustrations he loved from his youth. It's an amazingly beautiful film, but it would be insanity to show it to small children. It starts out with Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, rebuilding their house and farm from the cyclone, take Dorothy, who has been speaking of wild stories of cities made of emeralds and scarecrows who talk, to Topeka for electroshock therapy. The asylum they bring her to is a terrifying chamber of horrors, and when she escapes it for Oz she is confronted with incredible other visual terrors, such as the lunatic Wheelers and the Princess Mombi (a variant of both the old witch Mombi and the Princess langwidere from the Oz books), who exchanges pretty heads for her body the way other women change dresses. The scene where Mobi's headless body chases Dorothy through her chamber of heads (as the other dismebodied heads scream in horror) is one of the scariest things I can imagine a child ever viewing. But this is really a film for adults, and the creepiness of its details add to the mature viewers' pleasure. The sets and costumes are spectacular, the cast includes such accomplished actors as Piper Laurie (as Aunt Em), Jean Marsh (Mombi) and Nicol Williamson (the Nome King), and the David Shire score is one of the most beautiful film scores ever written--period. As for Dorothy herself, the producers chose such a unusually haunting Dorothy (with marvelous multicolored eyes and a curious plaintive quality to her voice) that the actress, Fairuza Balk, has spun a strong acting career from her early cult fame in this part. 
A106016KSI0YQ 0375724397 October 21, 2002 1 1 5.0 A ferocious and intelligent debut by an exciting new voice Paul Golding's superb first novel is a coming-of-age story of an extremely wealthy gay man whose upbringing amidst servants on a country estate on a Spanish island and then at the best Catholic British public chools would seem to an outsider one of exceptional privilege. But the story Golding's protagonist, James Moore, has to tell is one of considerable horror: virtually ignored by his self-indulgent and spoiled parents, he finds his boarding schools nightmares where his peers mericlessly attack or shun him, and his teachers either abet his tormentors or corrupt him sexually. The novel's superb titles carries multiple meanings: while James is eventually termed an "abomination" by his own father (following the words of Leviticus in its injunction against men sleeping with other men), more abominations might more readily those practised against James in his childhood. And yet by the time James is an adult, and narrates the novel for us, he had become something of a moral abomination himself, and of course not at all in the sense either his father or the writers of Leviticus meant. His voice has become full of rancor and venom, his snobbery ruthless and cruel, his capacity to love almost entirely stunted. Golding is quite unsparing in his treatment of his protagonist, and seems clear (through his use of Moore's purpled and poisonous narrating voice) that not all of James's failings can be laid at the feet of his parents, teachers, or tormentors. This is one of the most exciting and intelligent debuts in gay fiction since Alan Hollinghurst's THE SWIMMING-POOL LIBRARY, and the two works can be justly compared. Golding's James Moore and Hollinghurst's William Beckwith share much in common: in their expensive British educations, their sexual promiscuities, and their savage snobbism. But whereas Hollinghurst attempted to critique his protagonist's character via context (showing how obtuse beckwith was to anything but himself or his pleasures), Golding more convincingly and bravely allows his protagonist's lurid furies to stand as a more direct means of critiquing his excesses. The novel's framework, though interesting (showing an adult James becoming enamored of a male prostitute, and primping himself elaborately before their hired tryst), perhaps does not come across wholly as Golding intends: we seem to lose a good deal of understanding as to what has happened to Moore in the intervening fifteen years between leaving for Oxford and the framing sequence that needs elaboration. Still, the debut is magnificent; this may be the best new gay novel to come down the pike in years. 
A106016KSI0YQ B00004WG90 July 10, 2002 1 1 4.0 More brilliance from the greatest female comedy duo Sometimes French and Saunders are so dry you almost miss the joke, but at other times they're hilariously over-the-top. Most of the time, though, they're spot on, making you laugh at things you never knew would be funny. Though there are many superb movie parodies in this video, it's at its funniest when the two of them are just being themselves, having a (hilariously) intense conversation about Princess Di's superiority to Fergie. Even better, though, may be their genius parody of the life story of the Collins sisters, Jackie and Joan: Dawn, as Jackie, seems capable of moving only her lower lip, while Joan brings the same combination of glassiness and near-hysteria to everything from being offered the lead role in DYNASTY ("Aaron who?" she intones into the phone, blankly) to lusting after "that cheeky, clownish, Cockney fellow" Anthony Newley. 
A106016KSI0YQ 1590170075 June 28, 2002 4 9 1.0 Not worth a re-issue NYRB Classics was started a few years ago with the intention of re-issuing neglected cult favorite books which had fallen out of print; though many of their choices have been superb, a very few leave you scratching your head, wondering who is making the choices. GREAT GRANNY WEBSTER is one such choice. By all accounts, Caroline Blackwood was a fascinating woman: heriess to the Guinness fortune, she counted among her [physical] conquests Lucian Freud and Robert Lowell, and was a bewitching raconteur and bon vivant. But she wasn't much of a writer. Blackwood seemed never to have learned the lesson that a good fiction writer must show rather than tell. As a result, in this novel she tells us and tells us and tells us again what a monster the title character is, but Great-Granny Webster herself doesn't actually do much but sit around and show poor hospitality to her guests and relations. Yet still the narrator keeps fulminating against her for crimes mostly implied rather than real; as in Caroline Blackwood's final book, THE LAST OF THE DUCHESS, where she simultaneously weighed in again and again against the Duchess of Windsor's female lawyer, you begin to develop a perverse sympathy for the object of Blackwood's fury. Even had this book accomplished what it set out to do it wouldn't have been much: the two main characters, Great-Granny Webster and Aunt Lavinia, seem like nothing readers haven't already seen (respectively) in Dickens and Evelyn Waugh. 
A106016KSI0YQ 6302010985 April 26, 2002 12 13 2.0 Typically bizarre Hollywood history This movie really should have been called CARLOTTA AND MAXIMILIAN, because the doomy erstwhile emperor and empress get far more screentime than Juarez in this insane Hollywood concoction. Puppet emperors always make for interesting film stories (as in Bertolucci's THE LAST EMPEROR), but the Manichaean demands of classic Hollywood made Warner Brothers realize that no matter how much screen time they'd give to Bette Davis and Brian Aherne as the Hapsburg couple they could never sell them as heroes. So, they recruited Paul Muni, the studio's favorite portrayer of noble biopic subjects, as the glum President Beinto Juarez, and two of Hollwyood's most recognizable essayers of villainous roles, Claude Rains and Gale Sondergaard, to wear the black hats as Napoleon III and his empress Eugenie (Sondergaard is so archly evil she may as well be preparing to play the Spider Woman). Muni doesn't make much of an impression plodding around impassively as Juarez, and with his stony facial expression the screenwriters and director clearly decided they'd better do **something** to remind the audience he was playing the good guy. So, Muni is always photographed in front of pictures of Abraham Lincoln (to remind viewers he's the republican). Aherne and Davis fare much better as the tragic Hapsburgs, and the film does have one great scene when Davis has to go to France to plead Naopeon and Eugenie for support and goes mad before their very eyes. Though you'd never guess it from the film's general free-and-easy approach to history, this scene actually happened in real life, and the dialogue in the scene pretty much follows the historical record--and there's a great visual touch when Davis, convinced the Bonapartes are trying to poison her, runs out of into the Tuileries gardens as if possessed into the night, her beautiful silver silk traveling dress billowing like a cloud around her as she shrinks into the blackness of the night (and her madness). But this, and the film's lovely use of "La Paloma" as a recurrent musical theme, are hardly enough to sustain you through the longeurs of Muni stalking around like a zombie. 
A106016KSI0YQ B00005Y4P4 March 8, 2002 13 17 5.0 A dream of a recording DREAMGIRLS may be the closest thing Broadway has ever come to an authentic and richly textured pop/R&B opera. There are more than three dozen numbers in the show, which is almost entirely sung through.Not only do the songs reflect a variety of musical traditions, but they have a kind of musical sophistication, with key musical and verbal leitmotifs ("You were wonderful Miss Jones," "You're bringing us down," "It's just showbiz") accruing new meanings as they're repeated throughout the show. Most of the songs are sung as numbers by the Dreams and the R&B groups they meet, but they comment in fascinatingly textured ways upon the action of the show's major characters. Unfortunately the original show was given an extremely truncated cast recording that beautifully demonstrated the skills of the legendary Jennifer Holiday in the central role of Effie, but didn't give the marvelous libretto and score their due. Twenty years later, we finally have a full recording of DREAMGIRLS--with all of its complexity restored. It is hard to imagine that for a score of years people who were not lucky enough to have seen the original show on Broadway had no idea of the terrifically complex ensemble numbers such as "It's All Over" and "Heavy," which add so much to the characterization and meaning of the work. Some of the Dreams' hit numbers from when they become famous which exist only in a few tantalizing musical phrases--"Step On Over," "I'm Somebody"--are now available for the first time on recording. This is really a superb show, and more than worthy of a fullscale revival. And what a dream of a cast we have on this concert recording! Lilias White is a superb Effie White: although her voice, while magnificent in its own right, doesn't have quite the power of Jennifer Holliday's (but then, whose does?), she still manages to make the role her own in this performance. But the real miracles are the other two stars, Heather Headley (Broadway's Aida) as Lorrell and the inestimable Audra McDonald as Deena. Headley is really a revelation in her role: as expected, she makes Lorrell's great Act II number "Aint' No Party" a showstopper, but she also acts the hell out of the role's other moments in this recording, making her coltish and vulnerable Lorrell a real delight. As for McDonald, this may be the best performance she's ever given, which (given her exceptional work elsewhere) is really saying something. When this production was announced McDonald mentioned to the press that Deena Jones was a role she had always longed to play, and this production shows exactly why: the part is perfectly suited for McDonald's talents. She's superb conveying both Deena's sweet ingenuousness in the first act and her growing confidence in the second, and even tinges the role at the appropriate points with the right note of mounting panic (catch the Garlandesque rising gasp of near-hysteria in her voice when she announces in the Act II opening medley she's "bought out Europe"). And she's in splendid voice: her first rendition of the show's title number is the recording's true highlight, even considering the other treats here. Indeed, it's almost fortunate we have MacDonald's performance here for this one-time concert version because she's SO good that her Deena would never work onstage (given that Deena isn't supposed to be as good a singer as Effie--here, all three Dreams are equally superb singers). Given that this is a concert recording, there are a few minor glitches here and there that aren't what one would wish for: the actor who sings the Pat Boone-like final reprise of "Cadillac Car," for example, is pretty flat. But that's a small quibble. This is a production one could never hope to see onstage, and we are lucky to have it available on cd. 
A106016KSI0YQ 0375725083 December 31, 2001 3 4 2.0 A cold and unengaging exercise There are a surfeit of fine ideas behind Byatt's study of the problem of constructing biographical and historical narratives out of facts, and overall this novel makes intriguing points about what it means to tell a story basded on the truth, and the way this exposes the human need to impose order or sequence on that which might not adhere to any necessary shape. But this novel is about as cold-blooded and unexciting as can be imagined: the character Byatt pins the story upon, Phineas Nanson, remains largely an enigma until the end, and the novel's interest resides much more with academic halls-of-mirrors games than it does with fleshing out any of the other characters. (They all seem pretty stock: the earth-mother environmentalist, the pleasure-loving gay partners, the wise old professor, etc.) Nanson's task--writing a biography of an eminent biographer, Scholes Destry-Scholes--seems motivated for wholly unbelievable and vague reasons, and his views on literary criticism seem about twenty years out of date. Byatt seems to be playing chilly Borgesian games with this narrative: we can only hope she's worked this out of her system, and will return next time to a more engaging romance. 
A106016KSI0YQ 6303026206 November 17, 2001 4 5 4.0 A flawed but stunning masterwork Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Edith Wharton's greatest novel remains, despite its flaws, one of the most spectacular American literary adaptations ever filmed. Scorsese's fascination with the manners and mores of small inward-looking societies lent itself perfectly to this study, Wharton's most thorough study into the anthropology of Old New York: her fetishistic desctiptions of the porcelain table settings, home furnishings, and dress of the most elite members of the Manhattan aristocracy of the 1870s are fully realized in Scorsese's loving adaptation. There are sequences--in particular, the Beauforts' annual opera (stunningly orchestrated to Strauss's "Radetszky march" and "Kaiserwalz"), the two great dinner parties at the van der Luydens' and the Archers', and, most of all, the breathtaking archery contest at Newport--that are as classic as anything Scorsese ever filmed. Where Scorses seems to stumble, however, is with the acting of the film's central characters. Daniel Day-Lewis does a fine job of conveying newland Archer's neuroses and hesitations, but can't seem to bring off the dash the role requires: the awkward hats of the time don't suit him at all, and make him look as if he were once again playing Forster's Cecil Vyse. Michelle Pfeiffer, whom one might think was ideally suited to play the Countess Olenska, is often quite suitably enchanting in her beautiful Second Empire gowns, but also begins to exhibit the range of tics and mannerisms that marred so many of her performances after this time. (You can really see this in her "actressy" reading in a sledge of the telegram she sends Newland from Rhinebeck.) Fortunately, they're both offset by the stellar performance of Winona Ryder as May Welland: Scorsese gets her for once to underplay, and emphasizes her awkwardness in such a way as to make her character seem believably undesirable to her husband, despite Ryder's great beauty. (There's a breathtaking scene while she reads a telegraph to Newland from St. Augustine that conveys this superbly: as Ryder intones, against a hyperlush bank of flowers, her delighted expectations of her upcoming marriage to her fianc, Scorsese zooms in on her cavernous mouth as if to show her as an omnivorous monster.) This is Ryder's finest hour as an actress. 
A106016KSI0YQ 0393319059 February 4, 2006 1 1 5.0 A tale of two cities Elegant, meditative, and special, Patrica Hampl's memoir of growing up in St. Paul and visiting her ancestral home of Prague deservedly won her a Macarthur genius grant, and remains a classic of its genre. When it was published in the early 80s, the gorgeous Bohemian captial of Prague was sheltered from the American line of vision by the Iron Curtain, and much less familiar to American readers than it is today; Hampl's book details her trip in the 70s to that loveliest of cities to visit her family's origins and learn something about her place in the world. But the book is also a beautiful meditation on another exceptionally romantic, and often still neglected, city, Hampl's hometown of St. Paul, Minnesota. Stunningly situated on the high bluffs overlooking a chasmic portion of the Mississippi, the home of F. Scott Fitzgerald and the Empire Builder James J. Hill, St. Paul has declined in cultural significance over the decades, overshadowed by its younger and more prosperous twin city across the river. But Hampl lovingly evokes what it was like to live in this atmospheric city of decaying Victorian mansions overlooking the downtown from the heights of Summit Avenue, both as a grandchild of Czech immigrants working as servants for the enmansed and as a young woman striking out as a student and a writer. It's an unusual, romantically-staurated memoir. 
A106016KSI0YQ 094032279X August 27, 2001 14 15 4.0 A fine portrait of the artist as a young man Darcey O'Brien's fine Bildungsroman is a very funny and lethal depiction of a golden Hollywood childhood which begins to tarnish as his parents' careers do. The narrator's parents--a histrionic former screen beauty obsessed with sex and a former Western star of amiable disposition but sometimes hidden motives--unconsciously (and even sometimes consciously) wreak all kinds of havoic in their son's life, but as he gets older the son begins to fight back in covert ways. This was exactly the kind of book that the NYRB series was created to revive: a funny and poignant novel of sterling quality that somehow slipped through the cracks of readers' attention years ago and deserves a new chance. 
A106016KSI0YQ 0786706392 April 23, 2001 5 5 3.0 This will do There's something almost irresistible about the memoirs of a child of Evelyn Waugh, and there's much pleasure to be had in the first half of the autobiography. Auberon Waugh's dealings with his splenetic, conservative father--among the posh country houses of his family and their relatives--makes the stuff of a fine story, and Waugh brings great ironic humor to the table. Unfortunately, Auberon's own literary career is much less interesting, and concerns mainly petty squabbles and encounters with figures who are only of passing interest today: it's hard to get very worked up one way or the other, for instance, about Claire Tomalin's libel suit against him. Waugh's humor (like his father's) is not to everyone's tastes, but if you find his snobbish summaries and appreciations for the bizarre droll (as I do), you'll enjoy yourself very much. He is very much aware of his snobbism, as well as his father's, and his self-deprecating awareness of both men's failing is greatly appreciated, and makes the entire matter much easier to take. 
A106016KSI0YQ 6300213668 March 18, 2001 10 13 4.0 The last of the oldtime movie musicals There's almost no one between the ages of 45 and 30 who can't sing all the words to "Summer Days, Summer Nights," and that's probably the best testament to the enduring popularity of "Grease," which was really the last successful movie musical in the great Hollywood tradition. The film was the most financially successful musical ever made, and when it was released it was almost impossible to go anywhere in America or Europe that summer without hearing the film's hits on the radio. The central casting was just about ideal, with John Travolta perfect for the narcissistic and endearingly dumb Danny Zuko and the pop singer Olivia Newton-John as the virginal Sandy Olsen (originally Sandy Dumbowski in the stage version, but they had to explain Newton-John's accent and made her, somewhat bizarrely, a visiting Australian exchange student). Newton-John is extremely likeable and enchantingly pretty (with her highly etched cheekbones and big wide eyes): it's a real shame she never had the film career she deserved, because she is exceptionally winning in this film. Her singing is lovely too, although her big number ("Hopelessly Devoted to You") was written by her usual songwriter John Farrar and doesn't sound like any other song in the film's score. The rest of the cast is fair to middling, with Eve Arden basically walking away with the rest of the film as an Our Miss Brooks-like principal. Didi Conn makes the only real favorable impression out of the actors attempting (largely unsuccessfully) to convince us that they're teenagers. Stockard Channing is far too old to play Rizzo (although she's quite fine in both of her big numbers), and most of the actors who play the T-Birds are fairly annoying--they seem to be Borscht Belt comedians on special loan to Rydell High (that must be some exchange program). The film is not without its puzzling points: you never seem to figure out why the televised national dance competition is being held with only the Rydell kids participating, or why the final song celebrates how much the characters like one another when they seemed largely unable to stand one another at all during the rest of the film. But its worth watching just for Travolta and Newton-John, and above all for the fine choreography ("Summer Days, Summer Nights" is a particular standout). 
A106016KSI0YQ 0374524475 January 27, 2001 7 7 4.0 Like a Gainsborough painting brought to life Tillyard's book brings to life a composite portrait of four of the most glorious demimondaines of the eighteenth century, all four of whom led lives of incredible brilliance and sparkle. One of the sisters was the Duchess of Leinster; another married Fox; a third was the beloved of George III before he had to give way to politics and marry a German princess of much less beauty and vivacity. This book does a fine job brining to life the intricate world of the highest crust of Georgian aristocracy--it's a splendid follow-up for any who have enjoyed GEORGIANA, DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE. 
A106016KSI0YQ B0000041QP December 13, 2000 7 8 5.0 The greatest British opera As beautiful as they are, even DIDO AND AENEAS and Britten's own BILLY BUDD are just not up to the level of this, Britten's first "major" opera. The theme of an individual hounded by the community is timeless, but the possibility of Grimes's homosexuality makes the opera especially timely for the twentieth century. And have there ever been such beautiful and appropriate interludes, or as sophisticated muscial characterization in ANY national operatic tradition? The great gossip scene in Act II is a case in point: ever striking Ellen, Grimes cries out the phrase, "And may God have mercy upon me" and exits, as his phrase is taken up in a round through the different sections of the orchestra, mirroring the way the gossip is about to spread. Then the other characters exit their houses to address Ellen and one another, each using the same musical phrase as Grimes's, but using it severally to express eloquently all manner of things. First we hear it as frightened chiding at Ellen's indulgent behavior towards Peter, then as a sarcastic commentary on the town's likely propensity to gossip, then (finally) as the gossip itself about the attack, which gathers greater and greater momentum until the townspeople are almost hysterical with indignation. On the only other major recording of this opera (with Jon Vickers in the title role), this stunning sequence is bizarrely interrupted between CDs; although this set is considerably more expensive, its more proper distribution among CDs makes it infinitely preferable. Also, although the other set has a superbly romantic Grimes in Vickers, the role nonetheless was specifically written for Peter Pears, who sings here with great purity of tone. This is a famous historic recording: no 20th-century opera buff's collection is complete without it. 
A106016KSI0YQ B00004ZDV0 December 2, 2000 3 9 3.0 Some fun to be had, but mostly for collectors If APPLAUSE hadn't starred Lauren Bacall, it's likely it would have sank without a trace. There's some wit in the lyrics, but all additions to the story are nothing to compete with the original Mankiewicz screenplay of ALL ABOUT EVE; the music isn't up to Charles Strouse's highest standards (as set by ANNIE and parts of BYE BYE BIRDIE), and he is not Broadway's first and foremost composer. Some of the songs are fairly derivative (the opening number sounds very much like the opening number for COMPANY, except less interesting) even downright awful: why do Len Carious and the others keep making that dreadful beeping sound during "Fasten Your Seatbelts"? Has anyone who has heard this soundtrack or seen the show ever found any pleasure in "She's No Longer a Gypsy"? Still, Bacall's performance is something to hear. She's a non-singer, but even so there's a kind of musical quality to her abilities that makes her renditions of the songs (particularly "But Alive") very appealling and impressive. She's as memorable enough a Margo Channing to stand against Bette Davis, and that's saying quite a lot. Penny Fuller also acquits herself with great honor as Eve, although there seems to be little one can do about Len Carious's creepily bright tenor other than cringe (he was always much better cast in oddball parts, like Sweeney Todd or Buddy, than as a conventional romantic lead). 
A106016KSI0YQ 0140147551 November 2, 2000 7 7 4.0 A rattling good read Robertson Davies is, above all things, a raconteur, and the greatest pleasure of these three interconnected Bildungsromans is that each offers pure narrative pleasure as they each plow through the events in a different man's life, all of which are connected in some way or another with the miraculous and the fantastic. One of the larger concerns of the trilogy as a whole is made evident in the title of the first book, FIFTH BUSINESS: can people be said to 'star' in their own lives, or are they simply bit players in the lives of the more important? The three books go about answering this question in radically different ways, but each offers its own delights and its own enounter with the "world of wonders" existing at the edge of quotidian life. Along the way, the books also offer the scholarly pleasures that Robertson Davies novels always allow: you wind up *learning* more after reading his books about some arcane lore than you do through reading almost any other (nearly-)contemporary novelist. 
A106016KSI0YQ B00004RCZO September 3, 2000 5 7 5.0 An astonishing surprise Often dismissed as a vehicle for aging sopranos, THAS has existed only at the fringe of the repertoire for the last fifty years or so, and survives on cd only via a few deeply flawed recordings showcasing singers far beyond their primes. Thas, however, is one of the most demanding roles in French opera: it was not by chance, for example, that in the original script for CITIZEN KANE that Susan Alexander demonstrated her operatic incompetence as Thas, given the extreme demands of the role both vocally and dramatically. While Beverly Sills and Anna Moffo could adequately honor the acting demands of the role, like Mary Garden before them they were incapable of hitting the part's many high notes. At last, however, we have a THAS for the ages in this spectacularly sophisticated recording from Decca. The emphasis in this set is on subtlety. While Lorin Maazel, in the Sills version, conducted with great drama and pomp (as if to turn Massenet into Meyerbeer), Yves Abel emphasizes instead Massenet's delicacy, allowing the opera to seem almost entirely fresh and modern. The greatest beneficiary of this take overall is Rene Fleming, the first Thas to record the role at the height (rather than the end) of her career. Fleming turns the role into a career highlight: although she might have relied entirely on her voice's swirly majesty of tone to put the part over, she instead chooses also to interpret the role with great intelligence and tact. She emphasizes Thas's vulnerability in Act I, as if to make the courtesan's eventual conversion more believable, and allows her to be the "idole fragile" she describes herself as. Typically, her best moment is a quiet one: she transforms the little third-act aria "O Messager de Dieu" into a small masterpiece of pathos and innocence. The rest of the performers acquit themselves tremendously well. As Athanel, Thomas Hampson is in splendid voice, particularly in the first act; if one wishes he had at times exploited the role's dramatic possibilities a bit more thoroughly (especially in the third-act aria "Thas va mourir!"), his underplaying often seems to complement Fleming nicely. Vogel is a wonderfully overripe Charmeuse, and Giuseppi Sabbatini is charming as Nicias. This is a magnificent recording--I can't stop listening to it. 
A106016KSI0YQ 0771089554 December 15, 2005 0 0 5.0 The unexamined life worth leading (and reading) Probably Ethel Wilson's most delightful novel, THE INNOCENT TRAVELLER began as a series of short stories about Wilson's own family, with a particular interest in her silly, attention-starved, irrepressible great-aunt; Wilson's publisher insisted she turn the stories into a novel, and this charming one-of-a-kind piece was the result. Topaz is born to a wealthy Victorian family in the Five Towns, and lives an extremely protected life free from much harm or much meaning. What saves her ultimately is her own essential triviality, which allows her to live through a century on two continents with her sense of wonder always about her. The description of Topaz's first cross-continental train trip from the St. Lawrence river to Vancouver is a remarkable set piece, and displays beautifully Wilson's famous skills at evoking landscape and atmosphere. I was so happy to have discovered this little gem--it's not quite like anything else I've ever read. 
A106016KSI0YQ B00005JMXX July 19, 2005 6 9 2.0 More silly mayhem from Roland Emmerich Roland Emmerich should have been making movies with Irwin Allen in the Seventies, given his delight in providing different ways to visualize New York and LA getting it. Here Emmerich doesn't even try for the tongue-in-cheek levity that saved "Independence Day" and attempted to (but could not possibly redeem) "Godzilla"; everything is done with an absolutely straight face as the laws of physics and logic are broken repeatedly. The fact that he cast genuinely talented actors like Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward and jake Gyllenhaal to speak his wretched dialogue seems, paradoxically, actually to raise the camp factor considerably, as does the fact that this film is made with a genuine message. Global warming, we learn, is bad... spectacularly bad, of course. The resulting storms must naturally head for the world's two most important cities (according to Hollywood), New York and Los Angeles. We get to see various landmarks of these cities (like the Capitol Records building) obliterated, as if to prove that we are not in Kansas City or Milwaukee. The British royal family is also threatened, as if that were the only thing outside of the USA equivalent to the Hollywood sign or the Statue of Liberty. It's easy to scoff at Emmerich, but his films are not simply schlocky but also, fatally, incredibly visually unimaginative. Opportunities for at least some visual cleverness proliferate themselves throughout these films, and yet his expensive shots in this film of an oil tanker adrift along the flooded Fifth Avenue (for example) are not made to look to look beautiful or even remarkably absurd--just expensive. 
A106016KSI0YQ 0140161139 June 2, 2005 1 1 3.0 Some like it cold Elizabeth Taylor is a real writer's writer, which can be a term of disparagement as well as one of high praise. Taylor's novels always show amazing intelligence and care and devotion to craft, and at their best they can be moving and obsorbing; at their worst, however, they can seem a bit inhuman and cold. PALLADIAN, her second novel, falls into the latter category. This is truly a metanarrative, as its clever-clever title would indicate, suggesting not only the Palladian architecture of the estate on which most of the action takes place but also the realms of the intellectual, of Pallas Athena. The Austenian-named heroine Cassandra Dashwood goes to work at the estate as a governess, and dreams from the first of falling in love with her charge's widowed and mysterious father; Taylor acts immediately to deconstruct any such Brontsque narrative expectations by showing quickly that the true locus of interest should lie not with Cassandra and her employer but rather with her employer's dislikeable drunken cousin, who is sleeping with a pubkeeper in the nearby town. Characters are coldly sacrificed for the sake of narrative surprises and moral points; you end up admiring Taylor's skill and fine mind but not caring a bit for anyone in the novel at all. 
A106016KSI0YQ B00004WMHF March 29, 2005 2 2 4.0 Magnificent soap opera played out against Victorian politics After Susan Hampshire had played Fleur Forsyte, Becky Sharp, and Lady Sarah Churchill for the great BBC miniseries of the late 60s and early 70s it might have seemed inevitable that she was called upon to play her greatest part, Lady Glencora M'Cluskie Palliser, when the BBC decided to adapt Trollope's six "Parliamentary" novels over the period of three years beginning in 1974. Oddly enough, as she explains in an interview extra on this DVD, the part was originally slated to be played by Hayley Mills. But when Mills had to bow out for personal reasons, Hampshire was called to play the part she was almost born to essay, and the greatest treat in this terrific Victorian soap opera is watching her lovely and loopy "Lady Glen," the wealthiest titled woman in England who is yet so childlike and insecure she clutches a doll during her early married years. Hampshire intentionally makes Glencora maddeningly silly at times but also plays her always with a real core of generosity and kindness. She is nearly equalled by Philip Latham as her dull and pedantic but goodhearted husband Platagenet Palliser, the heir to the richest dukedom in England. The first few epsiodes of this series are a bit shaky, since the writers try to expand upon things that are backstory in the six "Palliser" novels, namely the arranged marriage of Plantagenet and Lady Glencora. Although the adapters come up with good reasons why Palliser would be persuaded to marry this frivolous (but wealthy) woman, they did not fully convince us why Glencora would give up her true love Burgo Fitzgerald for Palliser: we see her resisting and resisting the marriage schemes of her titled gargoyles of aunts, and then all of a sudden she's agreed to marry Plantagenet. But once the series gets going it gets better and better, and it has the added delight of a fully first-rate cast in the other roles, particularly Anna Massey (in a rare change from the unsympathetic roles she usually portrayed) as the intelligent Lady Laura Standish, who makes an ill-advised marriage to a repressive religious fanatic, and Barbara Murray as the fascinating Madame Max. 
A106016KSI0YQ 630179804X January 16, 2005 5 5 3.0 So close, yet so far Altman's follow-up to NASHVIILE (after having done THREE WOMEN in between) promised to do for the American family and the class system what NASHVILLE itself did for pop culture and democracy; the film doesn't live up to the standard of the earlier film by a long shot, and is much too wild and wooly to suit its topic. Yet it does have some great moments of redemption. The film explores an afternoon at the home of one of the great wealthy old families in Chicago--the Sloans--as Dino Corelli (Desi Arnaz, Jr.), the grandson of the family's elderly matriarch Netty (Lillian Gish), marries "Muffin" Brenner (Amy Stryker), the brace-faced daughter of a newly wealthy Kentucky trucking company owner. The scenes near the beginning of the wedding guests frantically trying to find bathrooms in the Sloan manor after the ceremony are as good as anything Altman's ever done, but the film loses a great deal of focus after that, it seems to be missing a center (not enough is done with either the groom or the bride--despite Stryker's promising performance--to make you care enough about either of them). And some of the bits, such as those involving the crazy security team hired to protect the wedding gifts, belong in another film. The film's great redemption is Carol Burnett's performance as Muffin's mother Tulip, a deeply conventional (yet very likeable) middle American woman whose life is turned upside down when the groom's wealthy uncle tells her he's fallen in love with her at first sight. At first shocked and (literally) nauseated, Tulip becomes slowly intrigued as she begins to see a possibility for her life she never imagined before. The emotional arc her character takes in the film is amazing: although Burnett's performance has some similarities to her work on her comedy show, it is much more subtle and fleshed out. Her Tulip Brenner, like the best characters in NASHVILLE, is someone you wonder about long after the movie is over: she seems like a real and fully developed person. 
A106016KSI0YQ 1903155223 October 15, 2004 1 1 4.0 The domestic side of a life of genius Now it is quite common to write biographies of the wives of great writers and thinkers of times past, but when Thea Holme, an actress living in 24 Cheyne Walk , wrote about the former mistress of the house Jane Carlyle it was very unusual. Yet the experiment was a success: Holme was a superior writer, and this short study of the Carlyles' lives at their home for over thirty years draws you thoroughly into its world of fighting with noisy neighbors, managing funds, and caring for small pets. Jane, the center of the book, emerges as hypochondriacal and at times overly sensitive, but paradoxically also intrepid and likeable. It would have been nice had Holme not taken Carlyle's career and the couple's courtship in Scotland for granted and provided more detail in these respectsm, but so much is given within here it is hard to complain. The book is ideally suited for its new edition through the marvelous Persephone Books; atypically, they chose not to use a period fabric for their endpaperes but instead wisely reproduce Roberrt Tait's famous 1857 "A Chelsea Interior," which shows the Carlyles among their beautifully wallpapered and richly upholstered library. 
A1060C12WJKGRF 0596003560 April 7, 2003 9 11 2.0 Not enough stuff I also agree I felt really cheated. There are a ton of topics regarding OSX from a Unix users's perspective I'd like to see covered and this book had about 5% of them. There is good information in the book its just not indexed well enough and there isn't anywhere near enough book to justify the title. Its more like a dozen good articles than a book.

Thomas Ashley Farrand is by far one of the western world's finest teachers of ancient Sanskrit Mantra and it's practice. By incorporating Mantra into our daily lives, it is possible change Karma and re-direct energy in a more positive flow, for ourselves and for others.

A106U0YDHQD779 B000056HM5 August 17, 2002 9 9 5.0 Baby Bottle Buffet Even though this appears to be out of stock, I have seen it at many stores, and it is well worth the trip to purchase it. The Playtex nurser has been around for a good long while, and for good reason. It works. This sampler package provides a great opportunity for parents and babies to test and see just which of the products work best for them. It comes with two different size bottles, two types of liners, and several types of nipples. I find that the drop in liners are so much easier to use, even though they are more expensive. There is, however, a major 'neighborhood' drugstore chain out there which sells their own brand of drop in liners, and they work just as well at a much cheaper price. They don't come in the dispenser package like the real McCoy though, so I just saved the Playtex box and refilled it. Bottom line-nice selection, trusted brand, easy to use, great deal. 
A106U0YDHQD779 B000056C82 June 20, 2002 15 15 4.0 Grows with your child Okay I admit, it doesn't have the charm of the old fashioned highchairs of yore... but you can hose it down rather easily if need be. (And beleive me, NEED BE!) The neat seat high chair suits us in a lot of ways. First, the seat adjusts for recline, which is good for younger babies. When I first put Ben in the chair, I had to laugh, because the chair seemed so honkin' big and he seemed so small! The seat also adjusts for height, which is great. Right now I have it on one of the higher settings, to save my back, but as he grows older I'll lower it and pull it up to the table so he can eat with the rest of us. There are a few height adjustments, so you can adjust to the height of a table, or breakfast bar.... once the tray is off, it's pretty low profile. The chair has wheels, which are very conveinient, and a five point harness, which seems a bit much, but whatever. I am a little worried however about how well the tabs on the chair cover will hold up. The chair cover is vinyl, which is very realistic considering the abuse these chairs take. But it has these cheesy little tabs that hold the pad onto the base. I think at the very least they should have grommets to reinforce them. (Think shower curtain liner!) But let's face it folks, you can't beat the price. Tons of features, easy to clean, grows with your child, and heck, it even matches my car seat, which always seems to be laying about the house anyway...gotta go, I hear a hungry baby..... 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B0000039WI May 1, 2005 0 0 5.0 One of his gem albums Eddie Santiago, by far a Puerto Rican salsa legend displays his exquisite talent in this album. No doubt about this album is vibrant, lively, acoustically refreshing and sounds just the way salsa should sound. This album has a combination of rhythms, the distinction is clear however, the melodies blend perfectly which compliments an already superb album. This album is perfect for listening, dancing or background salsa. Take your pick but it is sure worth buying. Enjoy! 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 8433924478 December 21, 2003 1 1 3.0 A simple storyline, thus an easy flowing read-3 1/2 stars As I write this review, I find it difficult to describe my thoughts, as the book is not action packed with neither events nor an intriguing storyline. The story revolves around the love relationships and ups and down of the protagonist, Blanca and as we progress through the book we learn how she deals with the various stages of her life that she experiences with her husband and two other men that come into her life at a later period of time. It's a mellow read worthwhile if you like the works of the author. I must compliment her prose and writing style. It's very exquisite and eloquent. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 8433968440 November 3, 2003 0 0 4.0 More repression, more strife, modern day Cuba I suppose Pedro Juan Gutierrez may actually be getting bored with his own uneventful life because this book Carne de Perro is a continuation of the episodes of his life that have been related in other books but the only difference is he has become more mellow in his style which coincides with the slow down of the events throughout the years of hardship. In Carne de Perro we see the same Pedro Juan G that we have seen in Trilogia sucia de la Habana, El insaciable hombre arana and Animal Tropical, one who is starving for a promising future, food, and women on a regular basis. His life in Cuba is a destitute one and the readers learn a little bit about life in a socially and economically repressed country whose revolution has failed miserably. Who are the victims?- the Cubans. Pedro G in Carne de Perro tells it just like it is but with much less anger and resentment. I enjoyed the book. It was short but the message was sent. It also was an easy read because I read all the others he has written and I have seen the different stages of the protagonist- Pedro Juan G in each book. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00009PY0Q September 4, 2003 6 6 5.0 Pure boogaloo! Colombian boogaloo! This salsa is all that it's expected to be. Typical Sonora Carruseles all the way. High energy, fast rhythms, excellent percussion, fusion of beats and most of all their trademark of "boogaloo" style salsa is noted throughout the album. I never had a doubt about this album when I purchased it but I was quite surprised. Not because of how great the album is but because how they are able to maintain the high quality of salsa that they produce. If I were to compare this album to another one in their repertoire I would say this one is similar to their previous production "De una vez gozando". Several songs caught my attention. I especially enjoyed #1- La salsa la traigo yo, #3 La Comay, #6 Repica el tambo, #7 Lo que pide la gente, #9 Rumba de mulatos, #10 Me goce el bongo, #11 Puras mentiras and #13- Amor mexicano- a beautiful, top notch cumbia. As you can see I almost listed all thirteen songs as my favorites. In a nutshell, if you know Sonora Carruseles style salsa or if you own their other albums: Heavy Salsa, Con todos los hierros, De una vez gozando or The Best (greatest hits compilation) shall I say no more. Just buy the album because as the title states "Sonora Carruseles te trajo la salsa" and it is to be enjoyed! 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 8433924680 July 16, 2003 4 4 4.0 A good read again- more of Pedro Juan G's revelations. If you are familiar with this author's writing style and his themes, you will easily identify with this book as it is an extension or better yet a part of a series of four books that depict Cuba from his own personal experiences (the other three are Trilogia sucia de la Habana, El Rey de la Habana and El Insaciable hombre araa). This one is more focused on two periods in his life and his experiences with two women in particular- Gloria and Agneta. Gloria is his Cuban interest and Agneta, a Swedish female that was a part of his life for a brief period of time. What we see in this book in comparison to la Trilogia and El Insaciable hombre araa is Pedro Juan Gutierrez in his fifties, still destitute, poor, unstable in every sense of the word (professionally, monetarily and relationship wise) who is holding on to a dream of being an author and a professional artist. Due to the numerous obstacles that stand in his way and his inability to dedicate time to being what he wants to become we witness the same issues that were part of his life in his earlier years as a younger person. His life as we see it is dictated by his insatiable desire for a women's body, rum and drugs. Out from these experiences the reader is also getting a small history lesson about what Cuba was like in the 90's and still very much so today however, the 90's seemed to be the culminating point of the modern Cuban depression due to the fall of the Soviet Union. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. I was not at all offended by the language and vivid descriptions of his actions. All was taken in context. Once again I found this writing style of Pedro Juan Gutierrez daring but true and reveals details and the consequences that sometimes result due to extreme poverty. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 0521802989 June 7, 2003 4 4 5.0 A terrific all round dictionary! This is a very reliable all purpose dictionary that has approximately 110.000 entries and very up-to-date vocabulary of technology. I found this dictionary in my campus bookstore and immediately recognized that it was a quality reference. It is comparable to the Larousse version that's in circulation. The dictionary also has two helpful appendixes. The first one has sample letters of all themes and sample phrases of different scenarios. The second appendix has a range of grammatical concepts that are usually an area of concern for students. The font is just the right size and there are many examples provided of word usage and idiomatic expressions. This is the perfect dictionary for intermediate to advanced level students. The Spanish is quite diverse with Spain and Latin American terminology. This is a very complete academic dictionary at an economical price. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 8433924826 May 21, 2003 0 0 4.0 A beautiful memory of a daughter of her mom This book is the story of the author's memory of her mother's life and also a tribute to all the wonderful memories from childhood to womanhood that Soledad Puertolas shared with her mother. I found it very easy to relate to and very sentimental since many females have and have had at one point in their life a close relationship with their mom. The memories are based on her life in Madrid when Soledad was a child and then eventually married and had her own children at which time her mother played an integral role in the life of her children as a grandparent. The book to me serves as a reminder to all of us of the importance of familiar relationships and that nothing last forever. Important people in our life need to be appreciated and oddly enough we sometimes only realize that when we become older or when they are gone... forever. This was a nice read and a pleasant reminder. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 0070536805 May 10, 2003 21 21 4.0 A very handy bilingual resource This bilingual medical dictionary is a perfect pocket size reference for daily terminology for those working in the medical profession, students or simply for those who want to be able use medical terminology in both English and Spanish. The dictionary does not provide definitions of the medical terms or words so if your looking for a bilingual reference with definitions you should consult another source. The terms are arranged alphabetically and the equivalent word or phrase is provided from English to Spanish or from Spanish to English. For example: health food = comida saludable, to gain weight = aumentar de peso, vaccine= vacuna. The terminology is not at all complicated and is quite accurate. There are some practice dialogues patient- doctor questions and typical scenarios. The resource is perfect if you use it in the correct capacity, which is to quickly look up medical terminology and the equivalent meaning in English or Spanish. This dictionary is not an exhaustive resource; it would have been better if it were a little bigger. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 0760726906 April 8, 2003 4 4 5.0 A wonderful tribute to a community that deserves recognition I wanted to be the first person to review this book however the first reviewer wrote a wonderful review so I will gladly take second place. "Cuban time" is a wonderful tribute to Cubans and the Cuban culture that has been maintained by the exile community predominately in Miami. This book captures the essence of what Cubans left behind in search of a "free" life outside of Cuba. The book is tribute to their music, food, dance, language, soul and spirit. If you don't know about Cuban Americans purchase this book, which will enlighten you about the beautiful aspects (that we don't hear enough about) of Cuban culture. The book is bilingual side-by-side therefore you can choose to read it in English or Spanish. This book is truly a celebration of Cuban Life in America as the title states and for once it's the positive side that is portrayed of a community that has contributed tremendously to the city of Miami and to the USA in general. Pa'lante mis hermanos cubanos. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 0070580472 March 2, 2003 16 18 5.0 Buen repaso de la gramtica espaola This workbook is stellar if you are looking for a good review of Spanish grammar at a high Intermediate/ Advanced level. The books cover all the essentials of Spanish grammar and if mastered, one can speak concise Spanish with optimum grammar control. This book was designed to emphasize the fundamentals. Of course, Spanish grammar goes way beyond the scope of this workbook however, it's true to it's objective and it does clarify key grammar points that can enhance one's writing and speaking abilities. I believe workbook is a great supplementary study aid to classroom instruction. It has ample practice exercises and an answer key which is vital when learning a language. The workbook is a worthy purchase. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 0070572275 March 2, 2003 7 7 5.0 Excelente- me parece muy bueno para los estudiantes This is a wonderful workbook for Intermediate level Spanish students who wish to instantly build their vocabulary. The learning approach is thematic, meaning each chapter focuses on vocabulary pertinent to a theme such as: At the airport (En el aeropuerto), On the airplane (En el avin) or At the train station (En la estacin de ferrocarril) to name a few. The book provides ample practice exercises, with an answer key at the back of the book and what I found really valuable was each chapter has a mini paragraph about the theme in question that incorporates the vocabulary taught in the lesson. The workbook will definitely help the student to expand his/ her vocabulary because the chapters encompass everyday themes thus detailing everyday vocabulary. I feel it's more for an Intermediate level student because one would have to have a solid base to benefit from the new material presented in the chapters without feeling frustrated and also have beyond beginner reading and comprehension skills. This is a good supplementary study aid to classroom lessons or independent study. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B0000648Q9 January 26, 2003 4 4 5.0 Dominando la salsa! Well everyone here you have the latest cd by la Sonora Carruseles and it is no surprise that it is really superb. They continue with their style known as salsa-boogaloo, which dominated in their two previous albums- Heavy Salsa "and" Con todos los Hierros, and now they are definitely reigning in this category. The salsa in this cd is danceable, rhythmic, lively and once again they have combined various tropical rhythms such as charanga, pachanga and the 60's style salsa with strong sounds of the percussion and drums, two elements which separate their salsa from other groups. La Sonora Carruseles uses different nuances to create their music and in fact these nuances distinguish and liven up their sound. This cd has been made sparing no expense and the only thing you have to is buy it and enjoy it as the title states "de una vez". 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00000123M January 21, 2003 1 1 5.0 Another classic by Guayacan! With this album Guayacan treats us to another classic album that is full of great salsas. To tell you the truth the whole cd is wonderful with both fast and slow songs. There is definitely a varied style. The rhythm is typical of Guayacan, therefore if you know their style, you surely will identify with what I'm saying. In a few words, the cd is excellent and is a musical treasure for any salsa lover. This is some great music for dancing. Do enjoy! 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00006JIBK January 9, 2003 0 0 5.0 Another hard hitting album by Kinito When I discovered this new album by Kinito Mendez instinctively I new that it would be to my liking. This merenguero already has a fifteen year musical career and they have been fifteen years of success. This album, his latest production is no exception. I listened to it for the first time last week and what pleasure it was for me. The album contains all the components of good merengue. Teasing lyrics, catchy rhythms, creative sounds and distinct nuances which include the fusion of merengue and bachata which sound quite good. All of which will leave you with inkling to do one thing: dance like never before! I guarantee you, once you listen to the cd, you will let it play until the last song and possible repeat the cd. The album is truly wonderful. This one by Kinito Mendez is a special tribute to his most loyal fans and with this album he will continue to be "the man of merengue". If you like merengue Kinito Mendez style purchase this new release. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00000FY7X November 8, 2002 0 0 4.0 Great debut album! I stumbled upon this cd and took a chance on it and turns out that the cd is quite good. The salsa style is a cross between romantic salsa and "sonero" style which makes for a perfect blend. The acoustic arrangements and the musicianship are outstanding and Dominic has a convincing but not overpowering voice. There is a mix of salsas. Some slow some mellow and others are more fast paced and danceable. This new salsero has a future or at least he has gotten off to a convincing start. Some key songs are: "Niegalo todo", "Controlate", "Morir asi es vivir de amor" and "Que suenen los cueros". This is a seriously recommended purchased. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00005S6V5 October 10, 2002 1 1 5.0 No hay Limi-t This cd from Limi-t 21 is great too just like their previous one. They have definitely touched on something unique with their new style of merengue. This album in particular is extremely danceable, full of nice rhythms and very catchy lyrics. This album offers a variety of merengue styles fast, slow, upbeat, high energy whatever your preference is there is a song for you. The only song that does not fit into the selection is #7 which is more of pop/ latino tune that just has no place in a merengue album of this caliber. Other than that it's calle sabor, esquina amor all the way. Enjoy! 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B000001AQH August 15, 2002 0 0 4.0 Bachata treasures I purchased this bachata compilation cd in 1997 not expecting that it would have so many top hits and nightclub favourites. I could assure you that this cd is a treasure as it contains sixteen of the most popular bachatas in 1996 and they still are played today on the radio, in nightclubs and listened to by many bachata fans surely enough. The compilation is almost a perfect selection of bachatas especially the first eight songs. The big hits in this compilation cd are: Amores extranos, Piensa en mi, Si algun dia la ves, El verde de tus ojos (the original version by Kiko Rodriguez) & Si supiera. The cd has a mix of danceable bachatas and slower ones for your listening pleasure. Don't miss out on this album. The title is " Super Bachatazos 96" but these are super bachatazos "for life". 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 0679756779 June 30, 2002 7 8 5.0 Un libro maravilloso- un buen retrato de su propia vida I read this book three years ago and was very impressed with the way the themes were developed by Esmeralda Santiago. The book is a reflection of the Puerto Rican society in the time when Esmeralda Santiago was a young girl. Therefore, it is true reflection of how many Puerto Ricans lived and struggled to ascertain life's most basic needs. I like the fact that Esmeralda did not leave a pillow unturned while describing family situations, how the father left the family to survive with very little income and lastly their move to NYC in search of better opportunities. The reader can identify with Puerto Rican culture and what it means to be Puerto Rican because of the way Esmeralda describes her life in a language that's very adecuate, full of descriptions and expressions of her deepest sentiments. The beauty and simplicity of her vocabulary facilitates one's understanding of the book, the themes and situations presented. Overall, it is an exemplary memoir that paints a very real description of the ups and downs of the Puerto Rican society in the fifties. I recommend this book to all those who are fond of literature of any kind. ------- Le este libro hace tres aos y qued muy impresionada con el tema que ha sido muy bien desarrollado por Esmeraldo Santiago. El libro realmente es un reflejo de la sociedad puertorriquea en aquella poca cuando Esmeralda Santigao era nia. Por lo tanto, es un retrato real de como muchos puertorriqueos vivan y luchaban para tener las cosas ms bsicas de la vida. Me gust mucho el hecho de que Esmeralda no escatim en los detalles al describir los episodios de su familia, de como su pap dej a la familia para sobrevivir con pocos recursos y finalmente de la mudanza a Nueva York en busca de nuevas oportunidades. La manera en que Esmeralda describe su vida en un lenguaje adecuado, lleno de descripciones y de expresin de sus ms profundos sentimientos hace que el lector se identifique con "la cultura puertorriquea" y lo que significa ser parte de esa cultura siendo puertorriqueo/a o no. La belleza y sencillez de su lxico facilita la comprensin del libro y el entendimiento de los varios temas y asuntos que se presentan. Por lo general, es un libro ejemplar que pinta una descripcin muy verdadera de los avatares de la sociedad puertorriquea en los aos cincuenta. Recomiendo este libro a los amantes de la buena lectura. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 1563249367 April 2, 2002 190 190 5.0 A historical portrait & revelation- un chin de su historia! This book is a fascinating journey through the history of the Dominican Republic from the time of recorded discovery by Christopher Columbus in 1492 to present day historical events. "Quisqueya la Bella" is an enlightening historical book that vividly describes the history and culture of a caribbean nation that is usually overshadowed by most historians but whose history, if known and understood, definitely answers the many questions about Dominicans, dominican culture, the Caribbean and caribbean people in general. As a person of caribbean heritage, I consider the study and understanding of any caribbean country of vital importance since all have many elements in common. After my first visit to the DR in 1997 and many thereafter, I realized the immediate need to understand as much as possible about the history and culture of this diverse caribbean nation. Alan Cambeira's book is an eye-opener and definitely answered many questions that I had. It also provided historical and cultural details that were foreign to my knowledege. The book will give you insight to the the mixture of the three cultures that compose the demographic make up of Dominicnas- the Indigenous, the African and the European Spanish, racial issues- which still need to be dealt with today by Dominican themselves, the relationship between the Dominican Republic and Haiti-very controversial, the many years of dictatorship under Trujillo and the present day situation of the country. An added feature of this book was explanation of the "dominicanismos", language particular to Dominicans that is heard in everyday speech, written in newspapers and magazines and most commonly heard in songs whose meaning is not always understood if you are not a native or have not previously been exposed to dominican culture. Overall the book was well written and is not laden with irrevelant historical dates and details but rather factual, true and educational. Definitely a must read for anyone who plans to visit the DR or has already visited, is of caribbean heritage, Dominicans themselves or simply anyone who would like to learn more about "Quisqueya la Bella". A wonderful documentation! 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B0006J2FMG January 5, 2005 3 3 5.0 A legendary merenguero Tono Rosario is a legendary merengue artist and proves his talent once again with "Resistire". I never doubted if it would be good, I just wondered how much better can an artist be with a career and repertoire like Tono's. This album is a reflection of the Tono of old. It's a classic merengue album rhythm wise and the choice of songs that you prefer is up to you the listener. The first track was what set the stage for me "El Reloj" - a beautiful merengue and just a sign of the caliber of this album. The remake "Sombras nada mas " is impressive and "Te amare" is just outstanding. Tono is back- "llego el cuquito otra vez". Don't miss out on this one. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00005UOFC February 24, 2002 1 1 5.0 Salsa and Merengue supreme! This is a great compilation cd of the best of tropical music-Salsa and Merengue in year 2000. The songs on the cd were most likely chosen based on market popularity and surely enough the compilation is excellent. I browsed at the line up of songs prior to making the purchase and I instantly new that I had a gem in my hands just waiting to be played. If you are an avid fan of Salsa and Merengue you will definitely recognize all the songs and if you are new to both genres, I am quite sure you will be impressed with the selection. The cd has cuts from some of the modern greats of tropical music such as Son by 4, Eddy Herrera, Huey Dunbar and many more. This is the kind of cd that can be played through and through and also the music will inspire you to dance wherever you are. No regrets here. I highly recommend this lively compilation cd. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00000JGY3 February 6, 2002 0 0 5.0 Amazing! Este es el mejor disco de Manny Manuel como solista sin lugar a dudas y creo que ahora se puede ponerle en lista de los mejores de este genero musical. En este Manny demuestra sus inumerables calidades entre las que destaca su voz que es muy fuerte y unica en comparacion con otros cantantes. El estilo de merengue en este disco es muy caribeno y ademas muy puro porque no trato de combinar otros ritmos con el. Tambien, me fascino la bachata que canta (la # 9 Ponte en mi lugar) que es muy contundente. Si uno no lo supiera, pensaria facilmente que habia cantado la bachata antes. Recomiendo este disco porque es totalmente un exito musical. Realmente se merece mas de cinco estrellas. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00005RGLB January 1, 2002 0 0 5.0 Terrific cd This compilation by Platano Records can be easily considered a collector's item. Once again they have compiled the best of the best bachatas of our time thus creating a fantastic production and a fine display of musical talent. If you are familiar with the "bachateros" of today you will appreciate hearing some of the finest of all on one cd and if you are new to bachata this is an excellent intro to a musical genre that has it roots in the Dominican Republic but is now gaining international popularity. This volume is very similar to "Aqui esta la Bachata vol 7." in the sense that it is a very romantic compilation of bachatas and it has songs from the greatest singers of this genre. All the songs are bachata except for "El Colin" which is merenbachata typical of Antony Santos. I think that "Aqui esta la Bachata vol 8." is an outstanding compilation worthy of any music lover's patronage. I highly recommend this cd. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00004KH9S December 3, 2001 0 0 4.0 Different yet wonderful salsa A decir verdad este album es un poco extrao. A lo que me refiero es el hecho de que no hay nada sorprendente, nada fuera de que lo comun de hecho es demasiado suave para un salsero que tiene la capacidad para producir salsa mas brava. Sin embargo, esto no significa que el disco sea malo. El disco es muy chevere pero de a poquitos te va a gustar. Si eres aficionado/a a la msica de Tito Gomez opino que es una buena idea si lo compras para tener una coleccion completa pero si estas buscando algo brava y movido que te ponga a bailar esto no es el disco para eso. En pocas palabras es salsa de la buena para escuchar o bailar. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00004S9PX October 11, 2001 2 3 5.0 Bachata con tenura Creo que este disco de Junior & Jorge es uno de los mejores de la bachata que haya escuchado. El sonido es fuerte y la voz del cantante lder es muy poderosa. La bachata es suave de principio a fin y no hay ninguna cancin mala. De hecho todas son xitos especialmente "t vas a volar". Creo que la mayora de los amantes de la bachata conoce esa cancin. Cmprate el disco para que entiendas lo que te estoy diciendo. No hay muchos discos as en el mercado en el que cada cancin sea exitosa. Si te gusta el disco de Alex Bueno "Bachata a su Tiempo" te va gustar este de Junior & Jorge. Es un disco nico y sin igual. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00002Z78B May 11, 2001 0 1 5.0 Excelente de Verdad Necesito escribir un comentario acerca de este disco con el fin de salvar las aparencias. Segn los comentarios que he ledo hay muchas personas que ya no se identifican con la msica de Grupo Niche pero creo que lo que pas es que han cambiado su estilo musical. Ahora (por lo que se ve) el grupo est usando diferentes matices que segn yo es tpico de la salsa de hoy da. Este disco me encanta. Tiene mucha energa, el estilo es nico y es fiel exponente del talento de Grupo Niche que es una agrupacin que tiene una trayectoria musical muy exitosa. Recomiendo que lo compres porque es salsa de la buena. Las tres primeras canciones te llaman la atencin y son sabrosas para bailar. Si eres uno de los que han echado este grupo al olvido por favor dale otra chance porque este grupo siempre ha producido msica excepcional y si este disco no te convence prueba los otros y tu vas entender que Grupo Niche es un grupo de primera clase. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B0001BS3T8 November 8, 2004 0 0 5.0 Simply incredible! I had no idea what to expect from this album because Wilbert Manuel is not a high profile bachatero. However, his talent does not need to be justified. This album has it all and for a second album this artist has gone from being very good to just outright sensational. This album combines musical elements that makes for terrific bachata music. The rhythms, his voice, the lyrics are all exemplary and the only requirement is just to purchase the album and enjoy this unique bachata music. The album has ten wonderful songs that can be played right through to the end. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 0972082107 August 24, 2004 40 40 4.0 An interesting historical overview I like the way Alan Cambeira starts this historical, social and cultural presentation by identifying Quisqueya because as stated many people still do not know where this island is in the Caribbean. That is important before going into details because it establishes the bases for understanding its history, culture and people. Also, I like the title-Quienes son los Dominicanos - a question I don't even think most Dominicans can answer but the book lays out a clearer path to an answer. It's difficult to contextualize many years of history into an informative overview but Alan Camberia has managed to make this a valuable and insightful presentation of Quisqueya and los dominicanos. More availability of reading material that treats the subject matter at hand is definitely needed in order to bring Quisqueya to the forefront. Its history is unique and its social and cultural diversity makes reading this textbook enjoyable for students and good reading material of general interest. Each chapter is divided into sub-chapters that briefly cover historical, political and social content about the Dominican Republic starting from discovery to present day. The detail is not exhaustive but thorough enough to paint a clear picture of the DR from colonization to its struggle for independence. The author reveals the strife, upheaval, turmoil, its relationship with Haiti and progression over the years until the DR finally became independent 1844. If you know the history of the DR, you will definitely appreciate this overview. If you are learning about its history for the first time, this reading material is a valuable simplified version that gives you a clear orientation of progression from colonization. Two added bonuses are the cultural and social perspectives which are important components of a country's history as well. The timing of the historical overview is key as the country enters into a new four-year period with Leonel Fernandez (as of August 16, 2004) after the country has faced it's worst set back in years under Hipolito Mejia. Keep this book handy as you watch how the Dominican Republic's new government and people rise to challenge that lies ahead. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 840803510X June 4, 2004 0 0 3.0 Good book but not an intriguing read Thus far out of all the books I have read about Cuba and its foreign tourists who go there for pleasure, which includes endless female encounters and excessive drinking, this book is the least intriguing. Although the themes are interesting and thus has the potential to be an exciting novel it lacks the exciting narrative that I have seen from others authors like Pedro Juan Gutierrez and Jordi Sierra who have addressed the same issues. The author should have been more daring and more revealing with his vocabulary, an aspect that would have created intrigue and curiosity. Overall the book was okay but too simple which made the read quite mundane at times. The characters were developed but relatively simple and predictable. In this novel the two main characters Mariano and Armando visit Cuba with the hopes of having the typical vacation that male Spaniards have in Cuba. They do have some encounters with a few women of the night but Mariano also gets to see the other side of the Cuban struggle through his relationship with a local, a Cuban female doctor who becomes his love interest. If you are interested in reading about prostitutes in Cuba and Spaniards who go there to solicit their services Jordi Sierra's books Regreso a la Habana and La noche de la jinetera are my suggested readings. Both are excellent novels on the subject matter and much better narrated than this one. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00004785Z April 7, 2004 1 2 4.0 A nice cd but not exclusively Dominican...per se I bought this cd a few years ago because I recognized a few of the artists on the cover but I was surprised with myself that I couldn't really recognize the other artists. However, once I heard the music I knew why. The music is "tropical" but I would not say Dominican. I think if you consider the cd from that perspective it's nice. It has a nice mix of tropical sounding music but the bachatas are weak. Good artists- Raulin R & Luis V but the songs could have been something more representative of bachata "del pueblo" which better identifies Dominican culture. I don't know what criteria Putamayo uses when combining these cultural compilations but they have to ensure that the music is a true representation of the people and it's culture. Like I said as a tropical cd (and that's how I rated it) it's okay. As a Dominican cd...it needs to have more authentic merengue & bachata. 
A1075MZNVRMSEO B00005K329 March 11, 2004 0 0 5.0 Unbelievable....authentic classic bachata. Heaven is the word. That's where this kind bachata will take you. Whenever I listen to music from He Pepo it just takes you back to another era. His music I classify as an older style. It's definitely for the mature crowd (and not in age) meaning for those who appreciate the older formula. The lyrics are authentic, well sung and the style is a classic slow rhythm. This is great music with a yesteryear feeling not for the average bachata crowd. Almost like a throw back to another era. Play this one and I assure you will not stop the cd until it is done. He Pepo....you have out done yourself in this one. A classic cd. Do enjoy! 
A1075MZNVRMSEO 8426412688 February 5, 2004 1 1 3.0 A solitary narration This is definitely the most unusual book that I have read since I have become an avid reader. There is no plot at all but the book is just a narration of the narrator's obsession for a woman named Aida who he falls in love with but more so in love with her body. The narrator is weakened; saddened, mesmerized by his love for Aida but most of all I would say ironically is an unhappy "solitario" because he does not really share a life with Aida but admires, dreams about her and has a relationship with her from a distance. The beauty about this book is the narrative because the vocabulary and use of metaphors are exquisite but the lack of a plot and true storyline makes this book a potential bore. Once you start read it you may or may not continue. This is not Cristina Peri Rossi's best literature. However, I still appreciate her literary work. 
A1075NTSI7NRLJ 0553562614 December 9, 1999 17 33 1.0 Lame. (unless you manage a pizza shop) So, over a decade ago I read Neuromancer, and I'm enthralled. At the time, I was a 13year old BBS geek moving into the internet (this is before gopher, and long before the WWW!). Neuromancer stuck out as being amazing. I loved the style and the concept of dark SF. Ahead 5 years, and I finally buy Count Zero and Mona Lisa OD. I realize I still love the entire concept, more now than ever, since I see how absolutely real its becoming. However, I never ventured past Gibson, as the "Mirrorshades" anthology pretty much told me that most other 'cyberpunk' authours bored me to tears. 5 more years, and someone recommends that I read Snowcrash. I also happened to find it the next day on a used rack. I bought it, read it, and hated it. Absolutely WORTHLESS. The plot was boring. The characters lifeless and stupid (I'm still reeling from how ridiculous it was to make the main character a katana-wielding wonderboy named 'Hiro Protagonist' -this isn't ground breaking, kids, its stupid). Skateboard kids who act as flippant, ultra cool couriers? Please. These are the sorts of things I'd have written as that snot-nosed 13yr old in an attempt to parrot Gibson. Then there's the constant Sumerian "plot" that keeps getting beaten over our heads (Gibson had voodoo, so I guess he needs something even more esoteric.. and unlike Gibson leaving us to figure it out, we get it all in MINDNUMBING MINUTAE). Yes, I'm glad you know more about that than I do, now shut up already, Neal. The whole religion thing with the boats, however, always struck me as somewhat interesting. I find it even more funny now that I've learned all about L Ron Hubbard's dead alien cult (scientology, see http://www.xenu.net), and I need to go back to further apprechiate this aspect of the sarcasm. Really, the only thing about this book at all that appealed to me was the opening about pizza delivery, and pizza in the future, and I figure that's because I managed a delivery store at the time and could almost relate. Skip this one, unless you're some sort of self-describe "hacker" or other, similar, techno-buzzword. 
A107I6YPYHLZIC 6305019681 April 11, 2003 3 3 5.0 Stevie Ray Pow! The DVD of this straightforward 1983 nightclub performance is incredible, although it is by no means a slick, made-for-video production like the Live From Austin Texas shows for Austin City Limits. Here, the camera work is severely limited by the cramped quarters and dismal lighting. And there are only minimal extras on this video that's a mere 63 minutes long. Audio is available in both Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, and PCM (digital) Stereo. Personally, I prefer the Stereo version. While the DD5.1 has greater spatial clarity and room ambience, the Stereo version imparts better bass punch, greater dynamic attack of the drums, and more overall sonic impact. In neither case is the audio quality quite up to top-notch modern recording standards, although it's fully acceptable. But Stevie's playing and singing are so powerful, so intense, so thoroughly engaging, that the limitations of the recording are irrelevant. He drips with sweat playing, and I practically drip with sweat watching him. The fireworks of "Texas Flood", and the subtle stylings and fabulous fretwork of "Lenny" bookend the range of the performance. The first time through, for most of the show I wondered why Stevie was slinging such a beat up old guitar when a rack of shiny new ones hung on the back wall. When he got around to his instrument-abusing rendition of Hendrix's "Third Stone From The Sun", the reason became self-evident. While "Third Stone" is literally a show stopper, I find it the least interesting performance on the disc, which only goes to show how great the rest of it is. No other music video or live concert audio recording that I have ever experienced does a more effective job of communicating the sheer excitement of a musician performing on stage. And more than any other recording, this one makes me want to run out to a gritty nightclub and hear some live music, ANY live music. 
A107O8UATN67M8 6302969352 October 16, 2002 4 4 5.0 Staggering! Steven Spielberg put it best: Kurosawa is every bit the equal of Shakespeare. No one opened our eyes to Eastern mythology, royalty, history and culture quite like Kurosawa. His films are like huge tapestries, both appealing to the eye but also educating the heart and mind to the rich, complex history of Japan. Seven Samurai is my favorite of Kurosawa's films (next to Dreams) because it is one of the most perfectly balanced films I have ever seen. The cast is superb, the camerawork is legendary, and the script is so full of wisdom and poignancy that by the end of the film you want to become a samurai. Whether or not it is the greatest film of all time is irrelevant because art is not measured quantitatively. It's about as silly as trying to figure out the greatest painting of all time. This movie is to be appreciated along the same lines as Beethoven's 9th. Simply absorb in the genius of the work and be transformed in your perceptions of what is possible. 
A1084J87F6KKDO 1555610730 February 19, 2000 7 11 3.0 Okay but not tastey The dry mixes are probably the best of the bunch, particularly the muffin mix. I tried to make the Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix and it nearly did in my Kitchen Aide Mixer. There was too much dough to process. Also the cheese mixture calls for egg yolks, but doesn't require that they be cooked to a high enough tempeture to kill the bateria. The hot chocolate mix was tasteless, I ended up adding more sugar and vanilla once we made the hot chocolate just to get it to taste like a boxed hot chocolate mix and it does not approach hot chocolate mix made from scratch. 
A1087EHT8T5KFI 0679403922 August 5, 2001 5 7 4.0 Ellroy riffs again In "The Cold Six-Thousand," the great crime noir novelist James Ellroy picks up right where he left off in 1995's brilliant, unsettling "American Tabloid." It's Nov. 22, 1963, Dealey Plaza in Dallas. JFK's blood is fresh, and the smoke has barely dissipated from the gun of alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. Weaving fact and fiction into a bloody tapestry of American politics and culture, Ellroy has created a sequel that is messy, disturbing, excessively violent and, if not as coherent and unified as its forebear, nonetheless still compelling. "The Cold Six-Thousand" allows Ellroy to expand on at least a couple of his epic preoccupations: the fact that America was never innocent (the memorable first line of "American Tabloid"), and that history, as only Ellroy could put it, is best understood when seen through the eyes of its leg-breakers. The result is nearly 700-pages-worth of corrupt pols, mob bosses, low lifes, pimps, whores, drug runners, lounge lizards and hit men blowing to smithereens the illusion of an America grounded in freedom and tolerance. Two of American Tabloid's pivotal characters return: Ward Littell, the ex-Seminarian turned lawyer who somehow works (and occasionally kills) for Howard Hughes, J. Edgar Hoover and Jimmy Hoffa; and Pete Bondurant, the equally corrupt and brutal ex-Marine who is largely animated by his ferocious ant-communism (particulary with regard to Cuba) as well as his casual racism. To this mix Ellroy adds a third fictional protagonist, Wayne Tedrow, Jr., a young Vegas cop unwittingly sucked into the vortex of the Kennedy assassination and its aftermath by his loathsome father, a right-wing Mormon who publishes racist hate tracts and pals around with both the Mob and the Klan. As with "American Tabloid," Ellroy throws his fictional characters into the blender of documented history. Tedrow, Littell and Bondurant are indeed leg-breakers whose twisted privilege it is to travel the years spanning 1963-1968, from Vegas to Laos and all points between, and to help spur the demise of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy. Their assassinations bring the novel to a climax and allow Ellroy, in the ruthless manner of Bondurant, to employ his own literary silencer as he sadistically muffles the American ideal. King and Kennedy play substantial roles here, as do numerous other high- and low-rollers from Vegas, Hollywood, and D.C.: Bayard Rustin, Sal Mineo, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Sonny Liston. But no true-life character is reprised with greater panache than J. Edgar Hoover. Ellroy savagely (and with justification) caricatures the FBI overlord as a kind of pixilated and paranoid auteur responsible, both directly and indirectly, for the savagery visited upon the Kennedys and King, as well as for the infiltration of gangsterism into the body politic. Ellroy's signature style -- simple declarative sentences (conjunctions be damned!) assaulting our senses like bass lines blasting from a stereo speaker -- might be viewed as off-putting or bordering on self-parody. Yet this seeming structural simplicity accretes into a dense, almost Joycean landscape where corruption, betrayal and greed are the only consistent signpoints. Plot lines overlap, sub-plots develop and then meander away, narrative voices shift, locales change and character motivations blur. In the end, our worst national nightmares -- JFK, RFK, and King; Vietnam -- seem even grimmer in their inevitability, thanks to Ellroy's profane but virtuoso riff on the dark underbelly of American history. 
A1087EHT8T5KFI B00003XAA7 May 23, 2000 16 18 5.0 Good Lord, a masterpiece? "Being way too tall for any self regulation/I'd invite the devil in and his entire nation/What in tarnation?" So asks frontman Howe Gelb in "Raw," one of the seemingly countless American Beauties he's created in the service of examing yourself, lacerating yourself and laughing at yourself whilst whistling by the old graveyard. (Helpful hint: the devil and his nation are the guests that never leave.) By turns funky, psychedelic and folksy, "Chore of Enchantment" touches so many emotional rails over the course of its languorous sojourn that you can't quite tell what's jolting you. Its truths are harsh, humorous, ironic and frighteningly on target, from gum drop stains revealing an absent heart on "Astonished" to a drunken binge that reconnects lost nights with fearful days on "Way to end the day." When Gelb whisper-croaks, "Reinventing the unending day/in high isolation," you feel his protagonist's buzz of happy futility. Sure, think Tom Waits. Think Yo La Tengo. Think Lou Reed. Hell, think Leonard Cohen or Neil Young (circa "On the Beach.")if you want. Think all of them, then throw it all away, because Giant Sand practically reinvents pop minimalism. Just let the beauty, sadness and mystery of "Chore" envelop you. (I'm not much for serendipity, but how else do you attribute the nearly coincidental arrival of "Chore of Enchantment" with the Mekon's equally forlorn but illuminating "Journey to the End of Night"?) Gelb and his crew have endowed us with something special and something stunning -- spiritual desolation has rarely sounded so lush and so damn true to the heart. 
A108AJDHNBV29M 068484558X December 4, 2002 2 3 4.0 Amazonian vacation This is one of those books to read when you don't have the money and/or time to actually travel the planet. I enjoyed that Sy both had a grasp of biology and is a truly talented author. She also obviously cares about the socioeconomic situation of the peoples who live in the area that her biological studies took her. This book transports you into a magical world in which pink dolphins inhabit rivers in a mystical jungle. Sometimes the truth is better than fiction. 
A108AVF62U97NY 0670031542 April 20, 2003 5 5 3.0 Master of Melancholy This novel is worth reading for its stylistic merits and subject matter. It is a simple tale of misfortune and misadventure transformed into legend because of the epic calamity that Lucy's transgression brings. I don't wish to go into the plot as it has been detailed very well by other reviewers. There are two extremes that I have noticed in the reviews for The Story of Lucy Gault. There are those who believe that Trevor has written a symphony about grief and forgiveness and those who have hollered "what's the point?" and bemoan the ridiculous remorse that Lucy clings to for the rest of her life. I believe that there is merit to both these points of view and the difference would be to ask yourself what kind of reader you are. Trevor can be appreciated for his sparseness and subtle style. This novel reads very much like a melancholy ballad. The beauty of Lahardane, the deep love that the Irish possess for their home and township, is deftly portrayed by Trevor with a few words. Moreover, this story of remorse and atonement is never heavy-handed. It is an intelligent and poetic meditation about a life that is resurrected simply to be placed in limbo until some form of forgiveness is given. I admire Trevor's style because he is able to contain a tale with such complex thematic elements and profundity within 200 odd pages. On the other hand, some readers will come away from this novel unconvinced by the premise of Lucy's misfortune, nor the choices she makes in order to atone for her 'sins'. I think in this sense, we commit anachronism - in a time like our's where individual choices and mistakes are easily corrected or forgiveness of oneself can be achieved through a therapist, it is hard to understand why Lucy clings to the belief that her life cannot resume without her parents' forgiveness. In this sense, Trevor seems to be overly dramatic, portraying an Ireland whose melancholy and pessimism creates its own tragedies. However, Lucy does not live in a time and place where forgiveness of oneself can be easily achieved and this story stands quite well within its particular era. I believe that Trevor is an incredibly gifted writer whose subtle prose and ability to convey depth of emotions with so few words is a refreshing change from more verbose writers. His Ireland is lyrical and tragic, and his story of how tragedy begets greater tragedy in the individual who commits a woeful act is conveyed with great skill and execution. While it is not among the most memorable novels, it is certainly one of the most well-written. 
A108AVF62U97NY 0679735976 February 26, 2003 10 19 2.0 Not for everyone William Styron creates some impressively tragic and melancholic situations for his fatally flawed characters. Their lives have a way of permeating your dreams after you enter Styron's world. A fine example of this is Sophie's Choice. The problem I had with Lie Down in Darkness is that the situation is overly dramatic. While I can understand Sophie, I cannot accept Peyton's insanity. Styron attempts to attribute Peyton's descent into madness to her childhood, and her experiences with her mother, which albeit unhappy, cannot plausibly be used as an explanation for the tragedy that ensues. The style is sophisticated, and the imagery and symbolism of birds as death omens create a forbodding presence throughout the novel. While the style is sophisticated, I didn't find the journey enjoyable because there were parts that felt tedious and long-winded. Mostly, it is just a depressing novel, with every familial milestone that should be joyous - such as a wedding, or Christmas celebrations - marred by a doomsday feel. You know that Helen will find some way to quarrel with her husband or Peyton and that the repercussions will resound throughout the entire novel, which feels like a lifetime. Novels about sorrow and lost can be enlightening and enjoyable. However, this novel requires stamina because it is very long. You sink into a stiffling world for the duration of the novel and you won't necessarily come out of it feeling rewarded. 
A108H0RI2LWLUO B000066JQU December 11, 2002 12 14 5.0 Excellent wireless bridge between 802.11b WiFi and Ethernet I am very impressed by the WET11. It is essentially an ethernet to wireless adapter that Just Works. It is unlike bridges, including the Linksys WAP11 v2.2, in that it looks like a regular wireless client to your existing wireless network. So you can use it with *any* 802.11b (WiFi) base station without having to configure that base station in a special mode to do bridging. The Linksys WAP11, by contrast, can only bridge with other WAP11s. In my network, the WAP11 is a client on my Apple Airport (Graphite) wireless network. I configured the WAP11, hooked it up to my remote ethernet device, and it all worked flawlessly. The WAP11 is surprisingly small - a bit larger than a pack of cards. The power cord transformer (wall wart) is also small. It doesn't cover up multiple outlets on a power strip like most electronic devices. At its current one hundred and five amount I recommend it highly. The WAP11 comes with an ethernet port (of course) with a crossover switch. The crossover switch means you can plug directly into another ethernet device (a PC, XBox, or whatever) without using a hub. Very nice touch. --Pat / zippy at cs.brandeis.edu 
A108H0RI2LWLUO B000006P32 June 26, 2000 1 1 4.0 daleks with moogs Where to start? This album is brilliant and alien. Add N to (X) has a clearly developed style, borrowing from Can, Kraftwerk, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Wall of Voodoo, Holger Czukay, Wendy Carlos, the Residents, and Portishead. The opening track, "We Are Add N to X", is an absolutely wonderful introduction to the band. Most of the other 12 tracks fit together as a movie score written by Daleks -- at times edgy and slightly menacing, but mostly wonderfully, absurdly weird. "The Black Regent" is one of the few duds; it's confined and doesn't go anywhere interesting. "King Wasp" is infectious. Highly recommended for Electronica/Ambient fans. --Pat / zippy at cs.brandeis.edu 
A108H2BUNCYDIA B00004YA16 October 17, 2000 1 3 4.0 Flashback to childhood I ordered this DVD with the expectation that it'd be an amusing return to childhood diversions of getting up early to watch Star Blazers before school. I was pleasantly surprised how well it translated to DVD and how well the story held up. No, it's not a work of genius, and I had hoped for some "DVD special features", but it was everything I expected and then some. 
A108H2BUNCYDIA 0671000683 May 12, 2000 1 1 3.0 This is starting to seem a bit formulaic Take "Task Force Blue" and move it from America to Germany, and you have a very similar novel. Same sort of "billionaire industrialist trying to take over the nation with the support of various dissident groups" plot. It's still a good read and full of action, but I had hoped for a more distinctive plot. 
A108H2BUNCYDIA 0451457366 April 10, 2000 4 5 3.0 Engaging but feels more like a screenplay This book is definitely entertaining and keeps moving nicely, but is fairly predictable and has some real plausibility issues. The technology curve is erratic at best and the dialogue seems to degenerate into shouting matches by turns. Not a bad work but don't expect a lot from it. 
A108XP24UESKSV 0451209249 July 21, 2003 9 9 5.0 Carla Kelly: The unrivaled talent This review is based on the first book, "Miss Drew Plays her Hand." I also enjoyed "Miss Grimsley", though it was more light-hearted and not as mature as "Mrs. Drew." Roxanna Drew was very much in love with her husband, Anthony, who passed away 9 months ago. She is still in mourning when her brother-in-law comes around with an offer to make her his mistress. Young widow Roxanna is poor and has two young daughters. Instead of accepting such a dubious offer, she rents the dower house on Lord Winn's estate. Lord Winn, Fletcher Rand, ex-army colonel, is plagued by scandal. Polite society no longer accepts him: he is divorced. Just before Christmas, he travels to Moreland--and is surprised to see a young widow and her two daughters living there. Lord Winn fits in almost immediately. He is delighted by the company of Roxanna and her two little girls. But fate has dealt them both a difficult hand. Throughout the course of the novel, Carla Kelly makes us laugh and pulls at our heartstrings--in the way only SHE can! It's sweet, it's touching, it's poignant, it's mature... Mrs. Drew is truly a magificent, moving tale! This two-in-one re-release of 2 previous Kelly novels would be an excellent addition to your shelves! 
A108XP24UESKSV 0451206797 May 19, 2003 4 4 4.0 Nancy Butler: A Sure Bet Ursula Roarke, a lovely (but penniless) widow, wants to sell her bloodstock to the Duke of Ardsley. What she REALLY wants, however, is to charm him into a marriage proposal. A union with Damien (the duke) would solve all of her financial woes. Unfortunately, His Grace isn't nearly as intriguing as Will Ridd, the duke's bailiff. Will Ridd has worked for the Duke of Ardsley for 5 years, and has worked hard to raise the perfect flock--for perfectly soft wool. Ridd's wool puts bread on the table for everyone in the town of Stranton--the people think of the bailiff as a sort of saint. Now the Duke of Ardsley wants to take everything away from Ridd! (But don't get me wrong--the duke himself is not without quirks and charm) The plot is a lot more intricate than I can describe in a few meager paragraphs. There is a lot going on in this book. It's full of passion, power, and heart-wrenching moments. I caught myself tensing up and tearing up throughout the entire novel. Will Ridd is a very different, very intriguing hero. And Ursula was a heroine willing to risk everything for love. That's definitely admirable. However, I thought the characters were a bit too irrational in the end. For a period of 20 pages, I was incredibly frustrated with both the hero and the heroine. Also, the book got a bit too melodramic, at times. In addition, I was able to figure out the "big suprise" when I reached the second chapter. Still, you can't go wrong to read this book. It's engaging and well-written the whole way through. Like every other book I've read by Ms. Butler: it's a keeper. 
A108XP24UESKSV 082177106X April 10, 2003 1 1 3.0 Good, but lacking in certain areas Penelope Harwood has spent six years putting up walls around her emotions. After having been jilted by a lover in her youth, she has resigned herself to the role of dutiful daughter, protective sister & spinster. She always knows what's best for her younger sisters--much to their dismay. She certainly doesn't want to see Celia, her flightier sister, with one of the rascal Winslow brothers. Lord Nevin, a half-gyspy upstart, travels to Harwood in hopes of putting aside the bad blood between his family and the Harwoods. He comes with a business proposition--one that surely won't fail. (The Harwood father has a knack for picking bad business ventures). Nevin and his cousin, Bryn Dawes (who always quotes poetry), find themselves caught up in the lives of the Harwood sisters. Many elements of this book made it quite enjoyable. Nevin was very alluring. He was a quiet, handsome, renegade type. The secondary characters were very well-developed, and I was just as intrigued by them as I was the leads. There were several twists in the novel, which made it enjoyable the whole way through. Bryn was an endearing character as well, and provided the means for an interesting secondary romance. Some aspects of the novel left me a little crabby, however. Celia seemed a bit silly for her age (my age as well), and her ongoing relationship with Theo Winslow was rather annoying. At times, Penelope seemed a bit TOO cold and TOO reserved. I really wanted her to open up (which she finally did--5 pages until the novel's end!) Also, the book seemed to be a bit longer than necessary. But don't get me wrong, it is good. More than likely, you'll enjoy it the whole way through. Shannon Donnelly should be commended on a solid effort. One can only hope the youngest sister, Sylvain (the shy, animal lover) will be featured in her own romantic tale! 
A108XP24UESKSV 0399152474 May 3, 2005 3 5 3.0 Tepid Grisham/Memento knock-off Alison Pagone committed suicide... or did she? She's on trial for murder, and she's obviously guilty... or is she? These are the tantalizing tidbits of information we are given at the beginning of "In the Company of Liars." Or should I say, the END of "In the Company of Liars." Initially, I was intrigued by the idea of a murder mystery told in reverse chronological order. Like many others, I loved the movie Memento, and the jacket of this book compares itself to that critically-acclaimed movie. I'm also a fan of Grisham, and the back of the book compares itself to that ultra-famous author. However, this book falls short. The "tantalizing tidbits" become a swell of fragmented ideas. It's not as clever as "Memento"--the journey backward through time gets old very quickly (did we need to know what happened EVERY day??). And the book isn't as engaging as a Grisham novel, either. "In the Company of Liars" boasts many fresh ideas, but it's not as unpredictable or fascinating as it would like to be. Overall, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. 
A108XP24UESKSV 0451210352 January 30, 2005 4 4 4.0 A nice, 4 star read Harriet Whitlow has a secret. Ever since her come out, she's been in love with her friend, George Clasby. But Mr. Clasby is a rake, completely unacceptable for a respectable girl like Harriet. Her father would not approve, even if Clasby DID think of her as more than a friend. George Clasby knows his reputation is less than spotless, but he wants to reform. To do so, he recruits the help of his friend, Harriet Whitlow. If the ton sees him in the company of Harriet, perhaps some of her respectability will rub off on him? Over time, Harriet piques his interest in other ways. But Clasby doesn't stand a chance, as Harriet's father seems determined to marry his daughter off to a pompous earl named Lord Grafton. Harriet is determined to win Clasby's heart, and to shake off the attentions of Lord Grafton... even if that means resorting to drastic measures. I was looking forward to "Miss Whitlow's Turn", as it has characters from two of Mindel's previous novels, "Miranda's Mistake" and "Kiss of a Highwayman." I was looking forward to Clasby and Harriet's story, and it does not disappoint. It's a very enjoyable book, thanks to Jenna Mindel's breezy dialogue and strong storytelling. Some readers might think the book's pacing is slow, but I didn't. However, there were a few incidents that didn't really settle well with me. Harriet, a supposed "paragon of virtue", puts herself in scandalous situations SEVERAL times throughout the book, and Mindel didn't even acknowlege all of them. I might be nitpicking, but I don't think it was acceptable behavior for a girl in the Regency period to slip off to a bachelor's town house. Harriet is a compelling character, but I think the reader was supposed to believe she was virtuous, but we're shown something entirely different. All in all, I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a light, entertaining book. If you enjoy this, and you haven't read them, you should certainly read Mindel's other books. My personal favorite was "Kiss of the Highwayman." 
A108XP24UESKSV 0821776460 August 29, 2004 3 4 4.0 Maria Greene gets it right Eliza Lytton is no pampered English miss. She grew up in Egpyt with her father, who was something of a researcher. Eliza needs to take her father's documents up north, and to ensure her safety, she hires a bodyguard to accompany her. When Captain Hawkins takes a job to escort a young lady and her aunt, he doesn't expect the journey to be so harrowing. Along the way, they encounter elopers, interlopers, Eliza's slimy ex-suitor, and a relentless flirt. In addition to this, their carriage is repeatedly vandalized, and a shocking proposal is made. The Captain has his work cut out for him--but he finds he wants to protect Eliza. Not only because she's his employer... I enjoyed this book. It certainly isn't "a notch above terrible", as the other reviewer suggested. I liked this story, and I thought it was a major improvement from Maria Greene's previous novels. Most importantly, I liked the characters. Ms. Greene's heroines are sometimes annoying, but I really liked Eliza. She's a good, rational, thoughtful person. And Leo Hawkins (our hero) was a nice, serious, upstanding fellow. They're just two regular people whose feelings for each other steadily grow. There's adventure and mystery, and plenty of despicable (almost TOO despicable) characters. It does have a big fault, however. I think it could've wrapped up more nicely. Some plots were left semi-hanging, and the ending was a bit rushed. But, all in all, a good book. 
A108XP24UESKSV 0821776738 May 21, 2004 2 3 3.0 Limping Corinthians! Oh me, oh my! It's the last summer before she must take a paid position, and Cordelia Bransford wants to make the most of it. She travels to Lodesham Hall to stay with her cousin, Elaine. However, Cordelia receives some unexpected news. Perry, Elaine's husband, has invited three of his friends to fish on his land. And Cordelia is acquainted with all of them. They called themselves the "Quorn Quartet", and they were terrible pranksters. Five years ago, one of the four friends, Cedric, almost married Cordelia. However, she secretly harbored feelings for Lord Matthew Allerton, who seemed to be the least obnoxious of the bunch. When Cordelia sees Matthew again, her old infatuation comes rushing back. As she begins to spend more time with him, she sees there is more to him than tricks and games. But is it love? Generally, I enjoy Victoria Hinshaw's novels. They're always pleasant, and they stories are basically good. However, they fail to move me in any way. This book is no exception. I enjoyed it to an extent... but it wasn't as engaging as it could have been. I expected more, even from Ms. Hinshaw. So, would I recommend it? Sure! It's good, but it's not great. It's nice for a bit of light reading. 
A108XP24UESKSV 0451211812 March 8, 2004 9 10 3.0 Be warned: this is NOT a Regency When a friend arranges for her to set sail from the coast of Devon, Lydia Peartree is expecting a one-day joyride. She is also expecting something different in the captain, who she accidently mistakes for a scarred old seaman. But Captain Matthew Frobisher is much, much more than she expected. She becomes intrigued by Matthew's pirate-like appearance and adventurous spirit. And it's a big surprise to learn he's a schoolmaster... he's training young men to become spies! Lydia, the daughter of a Russian princess, is also something of a surprise to Matthew. She is much more willful than he ever expected. Together (with the young spies-in-training), they embark on a venture beyond their wildest dreams. I was really looking forward to this book, because Nancy Butler is one of my favorite Regency writers. ...And I stress the word REGENCY. There is a big difference between a "mainstream historical romance" and a "regency romance." I have read many books from both genres, and I've come to appreciate the charm and sweetness of a Regency more than I enjoy the escapades and (for lack of a better word) smut of a Historical. Despite the time period similarity, this book, "Castaway Hearts" is definitely more like a mainstream historical romance. I've read a few Signet "Super" Regencies, and the "Super" usually refers to the extra 80-or-so pages. That is not the case with this book. There is also a pointed difference between these characters and the typical charming, society-minded Regency characters. Matthew Frobisher is an often-overbearing Alpha male who intrigues Lydia with his brusque attitude. Lydia is a former darling of society who COMPLETELY shirks proprieties. These two fall in love very quickly, and their romance heats up very fast. In terms of romance, it left something to be desired. I suppose it all amounts to preference. I prefer Regencies. This book did not transport me to the Regency world, nor was it enfused with the depth and insight I've come to expect from Nancy Butler. If I judge it against the mainstream historicals I've read, this book gets 3 1/2 stars. There were enough fights and rescues to satisfy any adventure fan. ...Personally, the thing I liked about this book the most were the young spies-in-training. One, in particular, stole my heart. If Gilbert Marriot isn't the star of his own story, I will be distraught. 
A108XP24UESKSV 0821775065 December 1, 2003 3 3 3.0 A good book, despite a couple of gripes Mariel Whitlow travels to London to spend time with her ailing grandmother, the dowager Duchess of Hale. Mariel, a meek, selfless widow, tells her grandmother about a few chance meetings with an alluring gentleman. Through Mariel's stories, the dowager duchess recognizes the identity of Mariel's mysterious man... and arranges for them to meet. Edward Hadley is a lucky, meddling, charming fellow whose good spirits have made him a popular man. When Mariel meets him, she's a bit guarded at first (why would he be interested in a widow with a 10-year-old daughter?)... but she is also susceptible to his charm. Edward is determined to make Mariel his lover before the end of the Season. The book has its share of twists and secrets, and Mary Blayney offers some good insight into the characters' feelings. However, I often thought the book was verrrry slowly paced, especially at the beginning. Also, I think I would've benefited from reading the author's previous novels (His Heart's Delight & His Last Lover). "Pleasure of His Company" is filled with characters from those books. Still, this book is enjoyable, and I really felt like I could empathize with the characters. Overall, 3 1/2 stars. 
A108XP24UESKSV 0451210441 October 14, 2003 26 27 4.0 Nice In "The Lucky Coin" by Barbara Metzger, Adam Standish has hit rock bottom. He hasn't a penny in his pocket--until a stranger in a carriage offers him "a penny for his thoughts." With this new penny in his possession, Adam Standish's luck begins to change. He meets lovely Jenna, and starts to believe that wishes come true. This is a fun story, and I've always been a fan of Metzger's humor. My only qualm lies within the tepid heroine. 4 stars. In "Following Yonder Star" by Emma Jensen, Alice Ashe is preparing to have an Irish Christmas--without Gareth, the beau who abandoned her years ago. When he shows up for the Christmas festivies, Alice has mixed feelings about his unexpected arrival. Gareth, who plans to leave after Christmas, starts to wonder if he'll have a reason to stay. He still have feelings for Alice. ...This was an interesting story, aside from the fact that it veered from the plot sometimes. 3 stars. In "Merry Magpie" by Sandra Heath, Charlie Neville blames the downfall of his marriage on his estranged wife's aunt's... bird. It was because of the drunken (yes, drunken) magpie that his infidelity was exposed. 5 years later, he returns as a more mature man, hoping to get a second chance. This story was pleasantly different in the way it consisted of mostly flashbacks, which eventually led up to a 10 page reunion between the couple. In spite of the lack of interaction between the main characters, I still enjoyed it. 4 stars. In "Best Wishes" by Edith Layton, newlyweds Pamela and Jonathan suddenly find themselves at odds with each other. They can't agree on anything, and both spouse and husband end up being miserable during different parts of the holidays. Together, they must search for some common ground. I really wanted to enjoy this story, but I was irritated by Jonathan's controlling behavior, and by Pamela's whininess. 2 1/2 stars. In Carla Kelly's "Let Nothing You Dismay," Miss Cecilia Ambrose finds herself in close quarters with the family of her pupil, Lucinda. She is intrigued by Lucinda's uncle, who is both caring and intelligent. But Uncle Trevor harbors a secret--he blames himself for a tragedy that happened many Christmases ago. Somehow, Cecilia must help him to rid himself of his sorrows. As I would expect of Carla Kelly, the character developement is superb. 4 1/2 stars. To sum things up: This collection of Christmas stories (all written by popular writers of the genre) is pleasant in every way, and does an adequate job of presenting the spirit of the season. 
A108XP24UESKSV 0451209230 July 26, 2003 3 5 4.0 Don't miss it! Miss Drusilla Herbert has taken on the position as a companion--to one of her mother's old school friends. Drusilla and Lady Brentford get along famously, and Drusilla agrees to help the lady throw a party in celebration of ther older woman's birthday. Enter Lord Brentford, Adrian Richmond: the Lady's son. He is suspicious of his mother's companion, so he travels to the country to see what Drusilla's all about. Adrian is intrigued by Drusilla, the beautiful country mouse with a brazen tongue. And while he's initially against the idea of a party, he eventually consents to it. Several party guests grace the pages of the novel with their unique presences. Lord Brentford's friends are dashing (and some of them deserved bigger roles). Snobby Lady Felicia is delightfully (but not entirely) bad. Every character adds something to the story--even Mrs. Knight's annoying pooch! Overall, the novel is light and entertaining. But it's also predictable. And if you're familiar with Regencies, it's really nothing new. Still, you should definitely pick it up. Every word is enjoyable. 
A1091G5Y87ZLU0 0515126772 January 26, 2000 3 3 5.0 When Irish Eyes are Smiling! Actually, anyone who reads this book will be smiling too! This is one of those rare stories that draws you right in. You feel as if you, yourself, are walking on the hillside, with the beautiful native flowers all in bloom. Or sitting in the charming local pub with all the delightful town characters, hearing the tales told from generation to generation while listening to the music a true Celt never forgets. A wonderful mixture of romance and Irish folklore, this book is a treasure! So get cozy with a cup of tea(and if you add a dollop of whiskey to warm the bones...nary a soul will think less of ye!)and have a grand old time with a truly pleasureable read! 
A1097ECLFAHINH 0471326046 November 27, 2000 1 1 1.0 Unfortunately I read the book... Fortunately you can skip it As I finish this book, I am asking myself, "What was the point?" There are basically three themes to the book: 1)A biography of John Sperling, the founder of University of Phoenix. 2)A documentary of the creation and growth of UOP. 3)An attempt to persuade the reader to support his "causes." On the whole, each is a miserable failure and a real chore to endure. It is a chore not only from the obviously biased and overly detailed material, but also from the way it is written. It reads with the eloquence of a junior high term paper of "what I did on my summer vacation." Throughout the book he writes, "Unfortunately this..." followed by "fortunately that..." If you were given a five-cent discount for each time either one of these words were used, the book would be free. The first theme of profiling John Sperling read more like a trashy novel than a biography of a leader. It details his sorted affairs, misdealings, and blatant disregard for anyone but himself. It shows a major diversion from the usual theme of business books where ethics is very important and that it is important to support your fellow human being. The portrait he paints of himself is one uncaring of other people personally or professionally. He demonstrates a pompous attitude in the extreme where he is simply "above" speaking to his family or marrying "his one true love." I simply do not get his point. Does he want us to hate him? Is he trying to say all leaders are scumbags like him? The book's historical look of the creation and growth of the University of Phoenix was one of its few redeeming qualities. It details the life of the company and its long up-hill battle overcoming resistance from the existing university structure, accreditation boards, and politicians. It is a case study of determination, overcoming obstacles, and creativity. While it is interesting, the blow-by-blow details become quite tedious and require a substantial amount of dedication to complete. The book also lacks objectivity as Mr. Sperling attempted to draw the reader to "his side" in condemning individuals and organizations that apposed him. With regards to this part of the book, the point is obviously to set up himself as a true visionary and some sort of corporate idol while at the same time disparage those who opposed him. One last comment, as I read the details of his sorted battles, I could not help but wonder if things could have been easier for the company if it were not for his way of dealing with others? The final chapters of the book titled "Giving Back" detail Mr. Sperling's other crusades that include seawater agriculture, anti-aging medicine, and his war on the war on drugs. His point in these chapters was obviously to build support for his next endeavors. Unlike other real leaders that "give back" by setting up trusts that support society, his giving back means creating companies that he believes will enhance society. If he is correct, it will be he who reaps the rewards in more wealth of course. Most would not call that "giving back" but rather "investing." His crusade on the war on "the war on drugs" is equally misguided. It started, not as a genuine desire to help society but to help his failed politician friend, Dick Mahoney, regain power after having lost out to a "republican." On the whole, the fact that Mr. Sperling titled these chapters "Giving Back" illustrates how selfish and misguided he is. Unfortunately the book is a waste of time unless one has a strong desire to learn how the University of Phoenix was founded. Fortunately everyone else can save their $20 and skip it. 
A109E01LB4H38F 0060584009 December 7, 2004 6 18 3.0 Not that bad When reading Evanovich, the first requirement is to suspend belief. She isn't a reality writer. Even with the Plum series, Evanovich has become more and more slapstick with each book. Before you buy this book, you have to know that real-life characters and situations aren't going to be there. This new character, which one must believe will replace the Plum series and none too soon, isn't bad. She isn't great either. Barney is a girl raised by a dad who owns a garage and she is most adept at fixing cars and engines. She didn't want to continue with this kind of work, so after getting a degree in Engineering she gets a job with an insurance company. Her brother, "Wild" Bill, is always getting into one kind of scrape or another. This time, he appears to have fallen into a serious, if fail the world is lost problem. Barney, as she has done all of her life, goes to Florida to help her brother and save the world in the process. She meets a man who drives race cars for a living and calls himself NASCAR Man. Of course she does. Just knowing this much, you know that the situations are over the top and a bit out in left field. Barney is a classier rendition of Stephanie. There are still the Evanovich trademarks of car chases and the humor that comes with those, strange,somewhat evil characters, and a studly romantic interest. This isn't the best book you will ever read - nor is it the worst. If you are in the market for total and typical Evanovich mind candy that is occasionally laugh out loud funny, often roll the eyes and groan slapstick - then spend the $$. 
A109E01LB4H38F 0060175435 January 25, 1999 1 1 5.0 Outstanding This is the best Trocheck book yet - and all of them are great! If you are looking for an amusing, yet stimulating mystery - this is the series for you. Get them all and have a wonderful time with Callahan and her House Mouse cleaning crew. 
A109WIE49N0GV B00007G1WO July 25, 2004 6 6 4.0 The conclusion changes focus WAR AND REMEMBRANCE - THE FINAL CHAPTER is the conclusion of the trilogy that started with THE WINDS OF WAR and continues with WAR AND REMEMBRANCE VOLUME 1. Unlike the first two parts of the story, the conclusion narrows in scope to focus much more on the lives of Natalie and Aaron, as well as Byron and Victor, leaving behind much of the epic saga of world war seen in the first two parts. Even the bombing of Hiroshima is only mentioned in passing, while the story focuses on Byron's search for his son. As was the case in Volume 1 of WAR AND REMEMBRANCE, the Holocaust is depicted with graphic reality, and can be quite painful to watch. However, this is one of things that makes WAR AND REMEMBRANCE so important -- current and future generations need to see this reality, to make sure this can never happen again. Why the two parts of WAR AND REMEMBRANCE are packaged separately is a mystery to me; both parts must be seen in order to get the whole story. But the entire epic saga is well worth watching and re-watching, so I heartily endorse all parts of the story. 
A109WIE49N0GV 0783225881 April 7, 1999 0 0 5.0 A completely wonderful movie FIELD OF DREAMS is truly one of the most wonderful movies I've ever seen. It is a simple, honest, innocent film, unlike anything else made in the last 40 years. It is perfectly suited for Kevin Costner's strengths, and it is one of his best roles. I envy anyone who is seeing it for the first time, because the film keeps surprising you with more and more wonderful turns as the end approaches. Keep the tissues handy! 
A10A0MBFUQ3V81 083081650X July 21, 2000 1 1 5.0 A Christian Classic This book is a must read for all Christians. It discussed the foundation behind real Christianity. This book can be read over and over again, while learning something new each time. 
A10A1HA8YZVB85 0451199685 May 6, 2000 12 12 5.0 This was wonderfully supenseful This is my second book I have read By Ms. Coulter. The first one was "The Edge" (which was very good.) I look forward to picking up another one of her books very soon. "False Presences" reminded me of some books written by Sidney Sheldon. That is probably what I liked most about it. Elizabeth is suddenly placed in a high profile court case with the dead of her husband and then because very rich after her aquittal. She must now make it in the world of business which she knows nothing about. Her husband's family is out to get her and ruin her. The family is run by the mother-in-law who believes Elizabeth has killed her son. There is lying and bethrayal,love and hate all the makings of a great book. What I most liked about the books was the friendship that developed with Elizabeth and her step-daughter,Catherine. Catherine started off in the book as a woman scorned and turned out to be a true friend. This books had wonderfully developed characters and constantly kept me changing my mind "who did it." 
A10AAKKOL2WXEV 1886414025 June 18, 2005 0 0 5.0 A look at the recent past and a prediction of the future Humans should not be treated as machine parts within a corporate or state system. In the end these systems will fail because all people seek freedom. The point at which this will happen is fast approaching, due to the development of the internet, improved personal health and mistrust of governing powers. 
A10AAKKOL2WXEV 0446512818 July 25, 2004 4 4 5.0 This book tells the truth The Diamonds wrote this book (also known as Living Health) in the 80's and it is has stood the test of time. It is not only just as important a piece of literature now as it was then, but I believe it will also be in 100 years time. The fact that a diet book has lasted this long is a great testimony, as after all, the truth does not obey time and will always win through in the end (however much it is critised by others). I purchased this book after reading their first book, Fit for Life. I can recommend these Fit for Life books for anyone who is seeking more energy, cure from illness, lower weight, improved health and also, spiritual awareness. Don't worry the book is religion free. However a side effect of following the principles is that after several months you should start to experience positive spiritual insights and foresights. This awareness has also been experienced by friends of mine who have followed the principles plus Harvey Diamond (he writes about it briefly in his book Fit for Life A New Beginning), James Redfield (Celestine Prophecy), Paulo Coelho (The Alchemist) and Mahandas Karamchand Gandhi (The Story of My Experiments with Truth). Special note 1: Keep away at all costs from Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil or Fat (it takes 3 days to pass through my system and absolutely saps me of energy in the process - it is a hidden killer from the unscrupulous food industry and can do as much harm as heroin). Special note 2: Keep away from mobile phones unless used with a Bluetooth headset (when I was on the phone for over an hour a day the radiation from my mobile phone sapped me of energy, sometimes for days until I added the Bluetooth). Special note 3: If you are a smoker, I would strongly recommend Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. It will set you free. Good luck and God bless. 
A10AECKZ0GRKG 0800757378 September 27, 2005 3 3 5.0 this book has helped me more than any other parenting book I disagree with the reviewer below. This book explains why kids act the way they do, it doesn't excuse their behavior or give them a license to sin because of it. I understand my children SO much better than before I read this book. They all know their temperaments and they can spot others' temperaments right away. This helps us understand people. It has helped me understand my husband where I didn't in almost 20 years of marriage. I understand my sister and where she used to offend me now I realize she just tends to be flaky. :) I could say so much about this book. I truly think every parent should read it. I like the one for adults as well. Last but not least this book even helped me understand myself. To me this book isn't unbiblical. It helped me in all good ways. I know how to specifically pray for my children and them understanding why they are prone to do the things they do or feel the way they feel....it's all good. I can't say enough good things about this book. 
A10AF4EZCTJ2OR 0873190440 September 24, 2001 7 8 5.0 info about the powers that be and the powers you cant see This book is an essential piece of any conspiracy theorist's library. It is packed with tons of important information. The sources and references he lists are easily researchable. He even has the gall to put a list of people in the back of the book who are part of the conspiracy. The preponderance of evidence that the author presents proves that conspiracies in this modern age are not theories, but are indeed facts. As a reader you can only conclude this opinion if you actually do your homework and research his sources. A.H. Krieg states that there are controlling powers in the world ,(the mandarins), who are actually being controlled by a higher, super secretive body of powerfull individuals ,(the satori), bent on controlling the world . In effect it is a conspiracy within a conspiracy. I give this book the highest recommnendation posible. If this book were given to everybody in the USA, there would be an epic and bloody civil war of which this country has never seen or ever imagined. I cannot express enough my admiration for this presentation. A.H. Krieg had a lot of guts to write and print this book. As far as I am concerned he is dead on. PLEASE BUY THIS BOOK AND PASS ITS INFORMATION ON TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW, FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COUNTRY AND ITS SOVEREIGNTY 
A10AGOL2EZVJUH B000002ACQ August 6, 2003 7 7 5.0 Scientific, dilerium madness!!!!!!!!!! Reading the other reviews, you get a concensus that Younger Than Yesterday and Notorious Byrd Brothers are finer Byrd albums, but 5th Dimension is the band's most seminal. That pretty much sums it up. The Beatles may well be the greatest group of all time, but for a few months...... in early '66......the Byrds were ahead of even the Fab Four. This album demonstrated so many possibilities for rock music that it should be considered the first truly "experimental" rock record. Not only did it open many doors, it encouraged doors to be opened......any doors. So, while their next two records can be considered better "Byrd" albums, 5th Dimension is the Byrds greatest contribution to music in general terms. It changed the landscape of what rock music could be. I was glad to see 5th Dimension finally remastered. The original stereo version of the album was poorly mastered and in bad need of an overhaul. Although the remastering is not perfect, it is definately an improvement over what had been previously available for the last 30 years, both on LP and CD. The mono version is far superior, so I hope some day a remastered mono mix will be available on CD. If you love this album and still have a turntable, I recommend seeking the mono version on the LP. And the songs? Well, there's not much else to add that hasn't already been said. There are a couple of observations I'd like to share: I will put in my vote for What's Happening being a fine song. McGuinn's guitar sounds more like Irish bagpipes than a sitar. Crosby guitar work on the Columbia version of Eight Miles High is brilliant. If you listen to any latter-day versions performed by McGuinn without Crosby, you'll find it lacking that punch during the solo. It just doesn't hit the bell without that chunky, yet well conceived rhythum. Ironically, I wonder why Crosby prefers the RCA version, where his presence is much more sedate and less a factor. The Columbia single of Why is not only the best of the available three versions, it also presents the most awesome tone I ever heard out of McGuinn's guitar. It simply proves that if God plays a guitar, its a 370-12 Rickenbacker! 
A10AGOL2EZVJUH B0000296XK October 16, 2000 2 2 5.0 Required Listening for Fairport Fans Raven Records has done a nice service by releasing these two gems on one CD. It makes perfect sense. Swarb released the records separately, but they were culled from the same sessions. And what sessions they were! Half of the material here is performed by none other than the entire FULL HOUSE line-up! All of the tunes are instrumentals, save for Swarb's pleasant vocals on Sandy Denny's It Suits Me Well. If you have all of the Fairport classics and are unsure about risking your bucks on the later material, this is well worth your time (and money)! It's head and knees above the Fairport albums that had just preceded it (Bonny Bunch of Roses, Tippler's Tales and Farewell, Farewell). An unsung Fairport treasure! Get this CD and enjoy it with a six of Old Peculiar. You will not be disapointed. "For tis now, a holiday"! 
A10AJHFKRZG4JC 0743203305 July 9, 2001 2 3 4.0 Although long, very rich and complete Although substantially long, this book is extremely imaginative and rich in detail, in both lore and fact. As in "Veronica," there are so many little connections throughout the story, it almost makes you want to plot a map or worksheet of people and places the story touches. The book is virtually two stories in one, bouncing between its two main characters. It exploits the writing concept of "suspension of disbelief," where the reader is left to either challenge the likelihood of story events, or go along for the ride. Magic realism aside, the story ultimately is a traditional one, but the creativity Christopher exhibits and the many fine details in this book make it a very worthwhile investment. 
A10AJHFKRZG4JC 0671036181 March 4, 2000 1 1 4.0 I liked several stories in this anth. very much "His Women" and "Old Love Affairs", two short stories in this anthology, are such wonderful pieces. I had read both of these when they appeared years ago in The New Yorker, and very much enjoyed reading them again. The stories in this anthology are consistent, and the world will greatly miss you, Alice. 
A10ATY8QTZ37ND 0743254260 November 16, 2005 2 2 5.0 The Perils of Deification It has often been the case that we tend to etch our hopes and dreams in the coattails of superstar athletes who exceed our expectations time and again. Each time, the bar is raised until the star is brought down to earth by these same expectations that made them stars in the first place. Such is the tale provided by Michael Leahy in this definitive work on Michael Jordan's comeback with the Wizards. The account provides details from Jordan's start as an executive to his comeback and to his eventual firing (not unexpected as it first seemed). Interesting details abound in this book in contrast to the droning sound bites found in newspapers who seem quite reluctant to call out the naked emperor. Examples include the true extent of Jordan's tendinitis, the effect of Jordan's injury to his right index finger plus Phil Jackson's thoughts on the comeback. Also, Leahy provides quite a convincing critique not only on Jordan the player but on Jordan the playing executive as well. My only problem with this book is that it tends to get repetitive at times - Pollin's firing of Jordan and the Karla Knafel story is retold more than once. However, it stands on its own in chronicling Jordan's days as a Wizard which luckily for Jordan will always remain a footnote to an otherwise marvelous career. Most of us would have considered that jump shot at Salt Lake City the highlight of our lives, but then again Mike still has more than half of his life to live. 
A10ATY8QTZ37ND 0060515066 March 26, 2005 1 2 5.0 A Dynasty's Death Throes Three years hence, Buster Olney brings us back to that fateful Game 7 in 2001 which effectively ended the Yankees' 3-year championship run. Interspersed with the narrative are interesting backgrounders on each main character of the Yankee team - Steinbrenner, Torre, Jeter, O'Neill, Brosius, Rivera, Girardi and Knoblauch. The Yankees that Olney describes in this book are a team with shared experiences from Torre's and Stottlemyre's battles with cancer to the loss of a parent for some team members. Particularly poignant was when Paul O'Neill returned to the locker room after the 1999 Series clinching game and realized that he could no longer call his father as he before Game 3. Shortly after, the door opened and in came Clemens, followed by Brosius and Sojo, all who have already lost their fathers comforting him. In the center of the book is the Yankee's indefatigable owner George Steinbrenner who'll stop at nothing to build a World Series Champion. From that fateful loss at the hands of the D'backs, he relied less on less on the judgment of his executives resulting in a team of All-Stars which relied less and less of that team dynamic to win games but fell short of championships. Though Olney may not have been aware of it, he has no doubt provided quite a convincing argument not only why Rivera blew the save in Game 7 that day but also why Rivera and ultimately the Yankees blew a 3-0 lead in the 2004 ALCS against the hated Red Sox. 
A10ATY8QTZ37ND 0752827839 January 2, 2004 5 5 3.0 Was not what I expected Though many think this book as a sequel to Matchett's first novel, "Life in the Fast Lane", its main thrust is instead Matchett's career path from a mechanic working in both Ferrari and BMW to the Benetton Formula One Team to his resignation and transition from champion race mechanic to writer. It still contains some interesting anecdotes though from Nelson Piquet's penchant for farting when the mechanic rests his head on Piquet's lap to adjust the ride height of the car to Michael Schumacher's very photographic memory - he can give the chassis' behavior as the car enters and exits every corner of a race track. Matchett also quashes notions about Benetton having a 1st and 2nd driver - all cars are created equal from the chassis to its minutest parts. I was disappointed with the exposition as the author seem unable to decide whether the book is about his career path or an analysis of a Grand Prix event. Would have expected more analysis from him i.e. what he thinks of McLaren, Ferrari, who the best driver is, etc... 
A10ATY8QTZ37ND 0672318865 August 7, 2003 1 2 3.0 Hard copy of online documentation Though this book helped me breeze through a project and enabled me to write stored procedures even with minimal SQL experience, I noticed that the information in this book can be found online. If you can manage to look at the monitor for hours at a time then don't buy this book, you can readily get the information online. 
A10AV96PB2945A 0060194790 July 20, 2000 14 14 5.0 (T)his (I)s (P)erfect What a wonderful book,for all who have ever had the good fortune to play the glamourous role of a food server.Funny,charming,and at times shocking(particularly Miss Ginsberg's description of Mother's Day in a restaurant)this is telepathic diamond for every waitress and waiter.Read this! 
A10AZ52KX1UM1N B00009IM5V January 5, 2004 34 36 4.0 This is an awesome "toy"!!! They think its a toy. You think its an educational gem. Everybody wins! My daughter got this for her birthday and she LOVES it! (So do I.) This particular pad includes a wrting tool which is not fancy but it does get the kids to write in the books where they are supposed to. (Just imagine! They are allowed to write in this one!) The books that are available-at a fee-will allow you to expand on anything your child has an interest in. They have books on music, Disney characters, reading writing, arithmitic, geography, science-you name it. The pages are so interactive and enticing. They even have some popular children's stories from The Magic Tree House series and the Magic School Bus series. Most pages feature games which are just plain fun and compliment the lessons on the page. The very best part is the fact that, with this leap pad, you can keep them learning from preschool to 5th grade (since this pad also accepts the older Quantum Pad books.) Each child can have tremendous control over what they will or won't do. The pad will read to them, define certain words, play games-all at the will of the player. Highly recommended!!! 
A10B8DKR3OYZYT B00009L532 June 23, 2003 0 2 5.0 What a great album! I have to admit, when I heard about this song on the radio, I wanted it, but just because it had Panjabi MC feat. Jay-Z's Beware and Wayne Wonder's No Letting Go on one disc. Anyway, I'm pretty glad I bought this album. I actually have to say, I though I like the Jay-Z version of Beware, the Twista version, also on this album is really good too (maybe better?) It has some good tracks from some strong artists, Lil Kim, 50 Cent, Sean Paul, etc. and some GREAT TRACKS from people I haven't personally heard of before. I have to say, I like the Kardinal Offishal song, Sick! If you want a great all around album remixed well with music from a bunch of totally different artists, then this is a great CD for you! 
A10B8DKR3OYZYT 0809225921 February 22, 2003 6 9 5.0 Emi Kazuko's books are great! She writes among the best cookbooks for American Audiences. I like this book because it feature many of the more, "comfort food" type of dishes that one would have in Japan, like Curry Udon. Its also a very visually interesting book. 
A10B8DKR3OYZYT 0439249546 February 22, 2003 0 1 5.0 Wow! Is there a more convinent, (or cheaper?) way to get these new classics of children's literature. I too was skeptical about these novels before reading them, but ever since I got to read the first one, I have been hooked. Great for people of all ages! 
A10B8DKR3OYZYT 193151447X June 10, 2003 0 0 4.0 Nice art but... My only problem with this series is that it is only 5 issues long and so as a short manga alot has to happen in a short amount of time. That tends to be why I like longer series. But anyway, I think the art in this is amazing and if you like CLAMP its a good buy. The only other problem with it, in my opinion is that I am getting kind of sick of stories about little kids who are geniuses and don't even have to ever practice anything but just suddenly get good at it without trying. Misaki gets an angel, and then like, 2 weeks later is in the National Championships? It's a little TOO rediculous. 
A10B8DKR3OYZYT 1569710813 June 10, 2003 1 22 1.0 Poor... This story doesn't make any sense. The only reason that people like it is because it is hyped so much. I read it the first time when I was 13 and even then I didn't buy into the hype. Then, I went back recently and read it again at 19 just to make sure that I wasn't being stupid and immature when I thought that the story didn't make any sense and was just tedious, and no, it was as I had thought, the story still wasn't that great. All I can say is that, though this original manga and the movie were both DOGS, for some reason Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex the new TV show is really good. I commend the director and studio who could actually do something with so little to work with originally. That's because they stayed away from gratuitous nudity and such. And because they didn't waste time with that, they could actually fit in plot. Amazing how that works sometimes. 
A10B8DKR3OYZYT 6305784116 June 10, 2003 2 4 5.0 Great music and setting. I love the French setting and the colorful characters in this movie. The music and characters are all so lovable, you'll want to watch it over and over again. 
A10B8DKR3OYZYT B000038AAP June 9, 2003 0 3 3.0 A step up... Definately better than BB1 but still not that great. Like I said, Square should stick to RPGs and stay away from fighting games... Though the character designs in this one were kinda cool at times. It got boring, real fast. 
A10B8DKR3OYZYT B00004YC3N June 9, 2003 0 3 3.0 Buy DY3 instead... They're basically the same, only 3 has improved on 2. You should just skip this and go straight for 3, or 4, which is coming out soon... There really isn't any reason to play this game anymore. 
A10B8DKR3OYZYT B00006LU8X June 9, 2003 2 3 4.0 Perfect price, fun game! This is a nice, colorful update on the original classic puzzler. Although I admit that it wouldn't really be worth it when the game was new and more expensive, it's definately good now that its way cheaper. Gotta check out the new one, also, I haven't played it yet, but if it's an improvement on this already fun game, it'll be great! 
A10B8DKR3OYZYT B0000296O5 June 9, 2003 0 5 1.0 Worst FF game ever... This game was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND BORING. I have played every Final Fantasy game, and this is the only one that I actually just turned off in the middle after getting totally disgusted with all the characters. Contrary to EVERY OTHER FF game all the characters are totally 2 dimensional in personality and all so annoying. It makes it worse that I was in Japan when this game first came out there, and so all I saw was the characters and FMVs everywhere, and I was really looking forward to the game. So disappointing. VII, IX and X are ALL so much better. 
A10B8MKCY4ROWV 0761946098 February 23, 2004 5 5 5.0 Buy it today--use it tomorrow! How many times have you purchased a book hoping to find meaningful and useful strategies and ideas that you can use in your classroom right away only to find out that the book is filled with theory? If you are looking for a book that you can take into your classroom, open to a certain page, and start using a strategy immediately, this is the book. What make this book different is that it backs up the theory with practial strategies that you can put to work right away. I have never been a fan of group work. It is difficult to manage and usually results in chaos. However, this book has dozens of practical strategies that can be used at any grade level and in any content area. Each strategy has step-by-step instructions and visuals to show where students should be in a group and what each students role should be. There are also guidelines for assessment, classroom management, physical room arrangement, and student and teacher roles. After reading this book, I cannot wait to put some of these things to work in my classroom. 
A10BC5NHJXLZL0 B0007RXDFK October 25, 2005 13 13 5.0 Awesome combination product. Better than Timex version. This little (inexpensive) item does a lot. First of all it is a rechargable LED flashlight you leave hanging in an outlet so it is always charged. It is an "ok" flashlight. If you slide the switch to nightlight, it is an automatic nightlight (comes on when the room is dark). In this mode the light will also come on when the power goes out. In a blackout your nightlights will automatically kick on. This one is better than the nearly identical timex model. The nightlight on this brand is white, instead of amber. Also, the exterior is more plain and looks better on the wall. Tough to beat this thing for $12. 
A10BVQGSC97B8 0446531588 February 19, 2003 8 8 5.0 Edge Of Your Seat Thriller!! Wow, what a book! It was a REAL thriller! Just when I thought I had it all figured out - whammo - another twist in the story. I Highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a suspensful, well-written novel. I had to force myself not to skip paragraphs because I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next! There aren't too many books around like that. 
A10BVQGSC97B8 0758201397 March 27, 2002 1 4 2.0 CRAZY BIRD I would only recommend this book if all the libraries and bookstores in your community burned to the ground and there was NOTHING else to read. Sounds strong, I know. But, believe me, it is not worth the couple of hours it takes to read it. I am 35 years old and could relate to the all the music references. That was the only redeeming thing about this book - that and the actual style of writing. Otherwise, this would have only gotten ONE star. What's wrong with it you may ask? Well, where to begin. It is obvious this is his first book. It is equally as obvious that he is a deeply religious man and that he tries to push God and his own beliefs down our throats pretty early on. But, I trudged through. Some portions of the book were tolerable, but come on. The main character hasn't had a drink in 10 years - and becomes a raging alcoholic in a couple of days. Then, as suddenly as he started drinking he stops and becomes completly normal - a SAINT even! The man is manic/depressive with a few paranoia complexes on top of that!!!! My point being, how can a character who goes to such extremes in the space of a couple chapters be believable? Can't be done. Shouldn't have been done. The ending was "happy" with all characters getting their just desserts. How cliche. 
A10BYR4GN1D86N B0002OOUPU March 26, 2006 2 2 4.0 It's a shame they aren't more well known I bought this CD after hearing the first four tracks off their Myspace website. The single "Don't Push" got me curious in the first place and Back To The Rebels and Home For An Island finished it off. Those 4 tracks remain the best ones on the CD and the rest of the album had to grow on me. That being said, I still love their other songs. One thing you definately get with The Exit is a CD full of songs unique to themselves. You have the harmonica driven Soldier and So Leave Then is peppered with the Saxophone. Overall I love they created 10 catchy songs that are unique. This type of music wasn't my type of thing until recently and I do not regret buying this. It can be found relatively cheap online but even then I'd pay $15 for it if I had to. If you find your way to their Myspace page and like the 4 tracks then this CD is for you. 
A10BYR4GN1D86N B000B5KRTI October 6, 2005 6 10 5.0 Shinedown shows much growth A lot of people have been disappointed because this isn't Leave A Whisper part II. I'm happy that Shinedown decided to do something different as they matured as a band as opposed to releasing an album of singles that everyone seems to want. This is one of those albums that, because it doesn't sound like their first, it's going to more than likely take some time to grow on you. And grow on me it has, I love it. The pace in this album as a whole is slower than Leave A Whisper but that's for the better. You can still feel the passion in each song and it's good to know they are writing music they can feel. There's at least no specific formula for the songs and you really are getting an entirely new album. The first track, The Dream, is just a minute long poem being said by a little girl to set the mood of the album. The material is rather dark throughout the album and it's a very interesting poem. Heroes is a solid opener about various people from Dimebag to the people in the band's lives that they've looked up to. It's not the best song on the album but it works as an opener. This is the only song where Brent sounds like Chris Cornell too, which isn't a bad thing. Next up is their first single, Save Me, which grew on me a lot. The first time you listen to it you may not be impressed but as you listen to it more the guitar solo sticks out and Brent's voice shines. It should be said that throughout Us And Them Brent has an amazing variety and retains his place among the best vocalists. I Dare You is definately different from anything they've done in the past and is a good song. My two favorite songs, Beyond the Sun and Lady So Divine, are amazing. Beyond The Sun starts off slow but the chorus is really moving. Lady So Devine is a 7 minute long song that doesn't get boring. There's an amazing guitar solo in it right in the middle and this song is the perfect example of them growing as a band. There's more guitar solos and creative guitar riffs that melt with Brent's voice perfectly. Back to the songs, Trade Yourself In's verses are sung in an addictive way that make the song stick out along with a solid guitar solo. Shed Some Light makes wonderful use of a cello and the slower pace fits well at this point in the record before the next three harder songs. Begin Again has another great chorus much like Leave A Whisper's songs did and for a first we hear Brent give his hand at some powerful screaming. Atmosphere probably is one of the few songs that would fit on Leave A Whisper and that's certainly not bad. Fake gets back to the feel of this album which is a slightly slower pace and no specific formula. The last song, Some Day, starts off really slow but picks up greatly and finishes the album strong. If you have the limited addition version(very much worth it with a 36-page booklet and 3 acoustic songs) you aren't done. The acoustic versions of Save Me, I Dare You and Some Day are all excellent and give a nice second view on those songs so much that you may even like their rock versions more. All in all, this album is going to do to Shinedown what No Code did for Pearl Jam. It's different enough that the loyal fans who enjoy music and want creativity will stay with the band and grow. The casual fans or ones that prefer an album of singles will depart in anger and feel betrayed. Change is necessary to stand the test of time and I only hope Shinedown will continue to be creative. 5/5 easily and one of the best albums of the year. 
A10BYR4GN1D86N B000A3DFSG September 3, 2005 7 7 5.0 Must have DVD for Shinedown fans If you're a fan of Shinedown it shouldn't be too hard to decide whether or not to buy this. I hadn't had the chance to see these guys in concert so this DVD was a real treat for me. I also definately plan on seeing them once they start touring for their sophomore album 'Us And Them'. There's a nice bonus interview with all the band members about pretty much everything from touring to their CD to what they are trying to do with their music. It is around 20-30 minutes long and gives you a good idea of who the band really is. Obviously, the big thing with this is the live concert that covers every song(including Simple Man) except Lacerated and one other. The concert lasts a little over an hour and there are scenes in between songs with Brent talking and riling up the crowd. It has to be said that Brent shows an amazing amount of emotion while singing. In the beginning of Simple Man he talks about tragedy and dedicates the song to the late Dimebag Darrell. He's even on the verge of tears while talking and in the middle of the song. It really enhances the experience to what is a beautiful cover to begin with. His voice is just as good as the CD as well. It seems like he needs to warm up a bit at the beginning but he gets going real well. Considering he is one of my top 5 favorite vocalists he did everything as I expected. In closing, if you're a Shinedown fan this is worth the buy. It's also good to tide you over before the next album hits October 4th. 
A10BYR4GN1D86N B0001Z36SW May 20, 2005 2 2 5.0 Can we say... original??? Of all the CD's I've bought in the last couple of years, this is probably one of the most original. That is in terms of both sound and content. To start off, let me just say that Joey Culver, the lead singer, has a most unique voice. I was immediately hypnotized by it and it really lends a hand into their unique sound. At times he sings powerfully and others he can give a very peaceful and soothing sound. The songs themselves are unique from the vocals to the amazing drumming(more on that later) to the lyric content. Like their name and CD cover suggests, they are fascinated by life outside of this world and aliens in general. Some of the songs kind of cover this theme but you can't help but wonder if there's other meaning behind them. For that they get a bonus point in my book. I mean, how many bands have written a song about Mothra? As for the drumming, Chad Kent is every bit like his nickname suggests. They call him Superman for a reason folks. His drumming is so fast and insane it almost makes you want to start rapping your fingers as fast as you can on anything around you. Particulary in my 3 favorite songs, Mothra, Agent Orange, and Aliens, he has some real stand out drum solos. The song from the Punisher soundtrack, Time For People, is what made me buy this album but I was blown away in the end. Get this album immediately and I'll guarantee you'll never regret it. Not a bad song on it and for that it gets a 5/5. 
A10C7GQEFJBR6E 1556524048 February 8, 2002 3 3 5.0 Forever a great read I just reread this book for the first time in years, and couldn't put it down. From the first page, Winsor grabs the reader and takes you on an extremely entertaining, fascinating journey through one woman's life against the backdrop of Restoration-era England. Amber is far from a moral paragon, and makes foolish decisions, but her story is still gripping years after this book was written. Other historical romances are pallid when compared with this vivid narrative. 
A10CLPRZY2GW5P B000003CY7 April 4, 2006 0 0 3.0 Not My Favorite This is a satire of the annoying disc jockey "personalities" who are all-too-apparent on radio today. As is so often the case with this sort of satire, it mimicks what its mocking a little too closely while not providing enough in the way of humor. There are some good pieces, like the PDQ Bach folksongs, but the music faded to the background when viewed alongside the obnoxious radio personalities. Some of it, was not only annoying, but kind of poinless, like the Elvis parody. I'm a huge fan of PDQ, but this album was too much even for me. 
A10CLPRZY2GW5P 0441104029 April 30, 2003 2 2 5.0 Redemption of the Dune Books I was nervous about reading "Children of Dune," because I was not overly fond of "Dune Messiah." However, once I began reading it, I found it to be an exciting, compelling story, filled with many surprises. The story takes place about ten years after the events in "Dune Messiah." Paul Muad'Dib's sister, Alia, sits as regent over the Empire, until Paul's children Leto II and Ghanima grow up. However the children, like Alia were pre-born with the souls of all their ancestors living inside of them. The story chronicles the corruption of Alia and the struggle between her, and children for control of the empire. This novel contains a more balanced mix of philosophy and adventure, mixed with very vivid, interesting characters. It is very well worth reading -- though no book can compare with the original "Dune." 
A10CMFL520Q7Z7 B000000TEO May 19, 2001 5 6 5.0 Inspired performance: a truly great recording Colin Davis directs the definitive performance of the Midsummer Marriage. Based on Covent Garden's second production of the Opera (it give the premiere), it is a performance which throughout communicates with huge conviction, intensity and Tippett's strange but compelling modern myth. If you treat the story as a mixture of "the Magic Flute", "The Tempsest", English folk tales and a 1950s domestic drama, you won't be far off. Singers, chorus, orchestra and most of all, Sir Colin Davis, leave one with no doubts about the greatness and universality of this work. Having bought the LPs (on Phillips) many years ago, the release by Lyrita on CD was greatly welcome. Highlights are difficult to choose in such a wonderful recording, but try Sosostris' aria in the last Act, Mark's Act I aria and the climax of Act III in the final ritual dance where Mark & Jennifer are mystically transfigured to music of power, not to mention considerable vocal vigour. Outstanding. 
A10CMI5RR4XDIV 0521649765 February 2, 2003 8 8 4.0 Nice balance of theory with code This book was pleasantly surprising: I had expected to see code presented with minimal motivation or discussion of the underlying ideas -- something of a "Computational Geometry for Dummies" sort of book. That's not the case at all. This is a bona fide textbook on the subject, suitable for an undergraduate course. It covers all of the the "classical" topics: convex hulls, line segment intersection, polygon triangulation, Voronoi diagrams, motion planning. The mode of presentation -- supporting a discussion of the theories with implementable code -- is actually a bit refreshing. For comparison: Other books, when discussing the line segment intersection problem (ie: Given a set of line segments, find all of their intersection points) simply assume that computing the intersection of a pair of segments can be done in constant time. This is not an especially difficult problem, but the discussion seems more complete with a brief description of how this might be done. The same can be said about other primitive tests and operations in other algorithms. Overall, this book can stand alone as an excellent introduction to computational geometry, but a serious student in the subject will want more: perhaps Preparata and Shamos or de Berg et. al. 
A10CQARS5BODEK 0394558235 June 4, 2002 3 3 4.0 Writing that inspires; a climax that fizzles. Despite what I'm about to write in this review, let me just state up front that I would highly recommend this book. Now to the task of dissecting Anne Rice's third installment of The Vampire Chronicles. Queen of the Damned further supports my belief that Anne Rice is one of the finest writers of our time. Despite the length of her books, she doesn't fill them up with useless verbiage. Her descriptions are concise but effect. The remainder of her writing is comprised of effective dialogue, compelling internal monologue, and enthralling action. As Rice takes us through 6,000 years of history, we're drawn into each time period through well-placed historical facts (or theories). But, of course, the most important aspect of these trips through history is the world that Rice has created, in which vampires and spirits exist. We have the additional benefit in this book of seeing this world through the eyes of multiple characters, as they tell the evolving tale of Akasha and the twins. Despite this tremendous foundation on which to build her plot, Rice falls just short of a rousing success in this story's culmination. 400 pages are spent leading up to the ultimate clash of the immortals, but if you blink, you'll nearly miss what happens. I'm not surprised that the movie (which I ashamedly admit I've seen) didn't have the same ending. I believe that Rice must've known she failed in the climax, because the denouement of the book lasts for roughly 40 pages, as Lestat seeks to fully grasp and understand what happened. Overall, the book is outstanding. The story is well-composed ... so well-composed, in fact, that it can exist regardless of the ending. 
A10CQARS5BODEK 0679743464 March 12, 2001 4 4 5.0 This book will turn you into a Murakami fan!!! In Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, Murakami has created a reality that readers will find hard to escape from. In fact, he's created two realities where readers are drawn in by the sirens' call of Murakami's use of characterization and narrative prose. Each character is unique and likeable in some respect (even the thugs), and, interestingly, by the climax/fusing of these two stories, no true antagonist is brought into the picture. One reality is that of a number-crunching "Calcutec" who, through hypnosis, is able to process various data through his mind, encrypt it, and write it back out without any memory of the process. Unfortunately, his kind is dying out from an unexplained shutdown of the brain. Other Calcutecs who received the same operation to facilitate their careers are simply dying in their sleep from no traceable medical problems. At the center of this dilemma are an eccentric old scientist and his chubby granddaughter, the only two that can answer the data processor's questions. In fact, it seems that the professor is at the root of the problem, since he first created this complex operation. Chased by INKlings (grotesque, underworld creatures) and thugs, the protagonist must venture through Tokyo's underground tunnels to figure out the source of a unicorn skull and the purpose of his most recent data processing session. In the other, parallel reality, the protagonist resides in a high-walled medieval town, inhabited by spiritless people and golden, one-horned beasts. Stripped of his shadow, he must regain his mind and his memories, and escape back to "reality." He and his shadow conspire to map out the town and find the Wall's weakness, but they are kept apart by the Gatekeeper, who controls the beasts and the impenetrable Gate. His daily task is to read the "old dreams" contained in the skulls of beasts that have frozen throughout the winter. Both realities are inseparable. Both stories draw to an unexpected conclusion. This book will leave you wanting to read more of Murakami's work. Like the American writer, Kurt Vonnegut, Murakami will stretch your imagination by presenting stories that will leave you saying "hmm" long after you finish reading them. 
A10D0KARUVLBSK 0812905822 October 10, 1999 15 16 5.0 Recommended only for the high-minded When I heard Pat mention this book in an interview on C-Span, I immediately shuttled myself off to the library. It was published in the aftermath of Watergate, and Pat's tone is understandably disgruntled and defeatist. I'm so tired of the liberal demagogues who label him a racist, anti-semite, or misogynist simply because they know that is the simplest and most spineless way to destroy a person's credibility. For anyone willing to go to the trouble to find this forgotten masterpiece, I swear that he actually refers to the early civil rights leaders as "heroes," and writes that "justice was on their side." How can the extra chromosome left wing explain comments like this, when they would have us believe that Pat Buchanan is satan? I saw nothing in this book that I would deem to be insensitive or xenophobic. But in a society where a guy can lose his job for saying "niggardly" I guess anything can pass for racism now. 
A10DE6RF8970ET B00006IUJ9 October 15, 2004 4 4 4.0 90's Early Cho and later Rudner These are clipped from A&E's Live at the Improv - total of 6 individual volumes, each with different talent, available also as a boxed set. Each concentrates on a 5-7 min. set comprising basically the most famous premises from each comic. Not necessarily a great or comprehensive collection, but nice as an intro. to each comic's particular style. Rita hosts. Rich Hall is just after his Sniglets run. Cho bit is not the MontgomeryWard set - it's the one about her name and parents.

A10DLBSCL6N7AW 0767900316 September 2, 2002 4 4 5.0 A peek into the urban world Reading 'The Corner', you are transported into West Baltimore and the life of the denizens of Monroe and Fayette. David Simons and Ed Burns attempts to put a face to the addicts that are normally ignored in people's everyday life. I was saddened by the hoplelessness and despair that most of the people felt, and also by the fact that these were real people, not characters that could be filed away for a later time. To use a worn cliche, this book is indeed an eye opener, telling the tale of people who fell and have no reason to hope for anything beyond the next blast from a pipe. This is not a book for the faint. The scenes are graphic and the writing allows for the reader to be there in real time as an observer. The writers chronicle a year in the life of residents who have their shares of ups and downs, positive and negative experiences. This is a book to be read with an open mind and open heart. 
A10DLBSCL6N7AW B00005LKIM September 6, 2001 5 9 1.0 Good bye Clarice Oh what a horrible movie! I fell asleep twice during the movie, very disappointed that number one, it did not follow the book AT ALL and number two it was just that awful! No wonder Jodie Foster passed on this movie. It was a stinker! There were so many plot holes that it was frustrating to keep up with this movie. The whole idea that Hannibal Lecter was in love with Clarice Starling was something new to me. The man is a manipulative person who likes to toy with people. He has no love for anyone. Julianne Moore did her best but she seemed to be going through the motions in the elaborate DARK *ss movie. What a waste. I wish I could give this a minus three star rating. 
A10DLBSCL6N7AW 0451192036 July 7, 2001 4 5 4.0 Civil Rights Revisited I bought this book after reading Uncle Tom's Cabin, because I wanted to see a man's point of view on the treatment of Blacks. This was very informative, and gave a view of a white man's life as a Black. However, as an African American, I could not help but feel sad by reading this book. This man had the opportunity to go back and forth as a Black, but many that he came in contact with did not. I wish that there was more written about how this affected the author's home life, and also how the author felt about the experience once time had passed. This is a highly suggested book for one who would like to know about the race relations of the 1950's. 
A10DMZD2HDLHUZ 0935218068 January 22, 2000 9 10 5.0 conceptual physics at its best I took this book with me on a retreat--and read it straight through, unable to put it down. Physics actually made *sense.* Yes, for topics like mechanics you need texts like Kleppner & Kolenkow (or the text of your choice, I suppose) if you intend to study physics more seriously. But the *why* of physics never made so much sense in K&K as it did in Thinking Physics. While a lot of physics (from what I can tell) *is* calculation, the heart of it (also from what I can tell) is in the understanding, the *why.* You won't get much math out of Thinking Physics, but that's what the *other* textbooks are for. And math without understanding isn't much help. Thank you, Mr. Epstein, for writing this book. 
A10DMZD2HDLHUZ 0674383311 January 22, 2000 6 6 5.0 medicine and its development in several cultures I ran across this in a high school library. A high school library, for crying out loud--and I don't believe anyone else had ever checked it out. It made wonderful Christmas reading. I suppose most people don't read about medical history over Christmas. I did. I couldn't put it down. Ancient Greece, China, India...I can't remember the rest. (That copy is still *in* the high school library...though temptation beckoned.) Majno covered medical practice (or malpractice from a modern perspective...) in loving detail. I wish my medical background were better, but I believe this book is honestly written and as accurate as it could be. Some of the research was eye-opening even to my poor ignorant eyes. Medicine isn't everyone's favourite leisure reading...but if it is yours, take a look. 
A10DMZD2HDLHUZ 1560761172 December 4, 1999 1 1 4.0 a fun Forgotten Realms book Normally I hate tie-ins for rpg's and so on; most of them are awful. But Cunningham's one of the (few) exceptions. Here she sets up an interesting mystery about a half-elf and her mystical sword, not to mention the tangled (and trying!) relationships between Arilyn (the half-elf) and the apparent wastrel, Danilo Thann of Waterdeep. My only complaint was the culprit's motives--seemed a bit too tied to the AD&D alignment system, and wasn't entirely convincing. But worth a look. 
A10DNCYK7YISHU B000008JJO February 8, 2003 1 1 5.0 "powerule's the crew for the future" ... not exactly "powerule's the crew for the future" boasts the lead vocalist Prince Powerule in the track 'Smooth' (which is exactly what it is)... They made some noise with the single 'Brick In The Wall' and they are credited as one of the first puerto rican hiphop groups to represent NYC... It's hard to think why this album wasn't really perceived by hiphop listeners... The first song I've ever heard by Powerule was from their insanely dope vinyl single "well connected / bright lights big city". Those 2 tracks were highly impressive and I desperately tried to search for more songs or information on this group... Which eventually led me to this CD!... which is even better than their comeback singles I must say from start to finish this CD was really really hot. They get fun, rowdy, relaxed, intelligent, and unbelievably dope all through out this entire LP. Tracks like 'pass the vibes', 'gots ta get this', 'smooth', the ill posse cut 'young stars from nowhere', and 'rub off the wax' would be a good enough reason to even consider buying this CD... EVERY CUT IS HOT!!! I was really confused as to why this group virtually vanished off the hiphop scene... Well I am pleased with what they have contributed to hiphop, even though their material is limited... My words are that if you feel like taking a dive back into the old school era, this would be a fine selection to hear!!! I'm Out... Mind Power!! 
A10DNCYK7YISHU B00006690H July 1, 2002 2 2 4.0 CD either loved or hated by Eminems long time fans.... This album contains the usual celebrity bashing, battle rapping, anger filled style songs... but it also contains a different side of Eminem. There are emotional songs, music / political songs, and Em even experiments by using different production methods for songs (more instrument filled tracks)... This could be an Eminem album either loved or hated by Eminem's long-time fans... some fans may be turned off by these songs because they sound less hiphop orientated, but for fans who are not afraid to hear something different this could be the perfect album for you... On an MTV2 interview Eminem stated that guitars are not used alot in hiphop and on this album he takes advantage of the instrument, and a good number of the tracks on this contain some guitar playing.... AND HE DID A GOOD JOB!!! It helped give the instruments more life and made them more tolerable to listen to as Em flowed over them... Lyrically Eminem's flow has improved VERY WELL and he still contains that emotion behind the words, but it seems his vocab has gotten simpler... but then again as long as he proves his point, big words don't' matter.... Eminem addresses musical / political issues on "White America" where he talks about how racism in music benefited him. He talks about his downfall relationship with his mother on "Cleaning Out My Closet". On "Sing For The Moment" Eminem talks about how musical influence on children may be nightmares for parents because they refuse to accept it. "Superman" is how Eminem brags he is the super-man that's SINGLE and brags about his lovelife. "Hailie's Song" is an ode to his daughter where he actually SINGS, which may have mixed reviews for some fans, but I enjoyed it... Along with his 'serious' songs Eminem also has the playful / battle tracks. "Without Me", "Square Dance", "Drips", "When The Music Stops", and a VERY VERY HOT TRACK "Say What You Say" where Dre and Em talk about how they handle their opponents... But some songs do fail to capture me such as "Soldier", "Say Goodbye Hollywood", and even "'Till I Collapse" (the drumline is IRRITATING in it and hurt the track alot)... Overall it's definitely a good album by Eminem... It may satisfy some, but it may turn off others... It matters how open people are to different material... There's still plenty shiners on here.... Only reason it doesn't get a 5-star rating is because it seems that in areas it could've been better, but its above average all over.... If u like Eminem, check out Chino XL... Chino, the King of Punchlines, was hiphop's first celebrity basher and he may have influenced Eminem to diss everyone too... give Chino his well deserved props and pick up "I Told You So" and "Here To Save You All"... I'm Out... Mind Power!!! 
A10DNCYK7YISHU B00004YWNQ December 17, 2001 4 5 5.0 Phenominal musical work of art... even though its sick 'Violent By Design' disgusted me with some of the lyrics, it was offensive, and it appeared to me as a verbal horror story... It has offensive lyrics to the catholic faith and a line insulting gays: ... (...)... This type of behavior is sick, BUT I LOVED EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF IT... Every aspect of this album has its own story to tell: the album pictures, the songs themselves, and even the skits... I believe the theme of the CD was visible in the intro "beware the beast man for he is the harvenger of death. He will kill his own brother to possess his brother's land. Shun him"... I believe the theme of the CD is showing you the beast in man, as Ikon, Jus Allah, Stoupe, and the many guests show... Production in this CD is phenomenal as I was listening to these tracks at night for the first time, I felt brought into the jungle where I was being attacked by people who murder for entertainment... Either the beats were scaring me or the lyrics were silencing me... I'm bein' serious if you pay a lot of attention to this CD, it'll scare you (literally)... Some of the best beats: Death March, Heavenly Divine, The Dear Hunter, War Ensemble (track 22), Genghis Khan (felt very powerful and easy to hype you up for something)... Best lyrics: every song has them: if Ikon and Jus Allah were looking for shock value. THEY GOT IT!!! Every single track on this including the skits were excellent. They even use voice samples 2 of which I recognized. One was the Undertaker from WWF and the other was from the movie Antz... the only thing that felt incomplete was Ikon and Jus Allah's performance in 'The Dear Hunter' with Chief Kamachi, they had very very short verses in comparison with Chief Kamachi.... but that doesn't really hurt the CD at all. This group has a unique talent. I hope one day these guys finally get all the recognition they deserve... I'm Out...Mind Power!! 
A10DNCYK7YISHU B000058T92 August 12, 2001 2 3 5.0 Gotta respect this smut... I'd actually consider this the third High & Mighty CD, just that there's a new member in the group, Cage. Cage has gotta be one of the best lyricists I've ever heard in a while, white or black I don't care what color, I consider him dope as hell... Anyway the theme set on this CD is pornography by sex crazed lyricists. Usually with a theme like that I wouldn't even give a glance at the CD, but since it's not by an artist with empty perversion (Jay-Z, Nas, etc...), and that the album is off a record label that's previous products I've growth to love and cherish, I bought the CD and was satisfied... I'd actually give this CD somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. It's not as good as 'Home Field Advantage' because of the lack of creativity in the lyrics and the less dope beats, but CAGE is definitely a pleasure to listen to. He's one of the types of lyricists that'll make you rewind songs to hear his verse again. Mr. Eon is also pretty good on this. And Mighty Mi does a decent job too. Beetlejuice ... well I just love that dude... Standout Tracks: "Talk Like Sex", "Botton Feeders", "That Smut", "54" I'm expecting more dope material off these guys, they're helping the unappreciated white rap community... I'm Out... Mind Power 
A10DNCYK7YISHU B00004TH6M June 4, 2001 2 5 1.0 Grammar?? From What Country?? Nelly shows us his magic on this release: write absolute jibberish, organize it with horrible computerized beats, sell out and make cash by the truckload... I'm still yet to understand as to why hiphop has gone in such a [bad] direction lately. MCs used to rap for respect and love and in the early 90s a branch broke off forming rap about "topicless subjects" , "drugs" , "gangsta / thug" , "money flashing / jewerly" , and "jiggy/ mainstream"...Nelly showcases mostly in the topicless subject/ jiggy mainstream area... Even worse Nelly had the nerve to diss Common during an interview. He stated something like "oh i don't need to rhyme about topics in my songs, i don't have to go on a level and put extra thought into something that has nothing to deal with rap music like Common or someone" he stated harshly... and to make matters even worse Country Grammar is nominated for best rap album grammy while Like Water For Chocolate (Common) isn't [....] with lyrics like "eehh ahh uh oh..shimmy ya" it seems Nelly is a crossbreed of illiterate and teletubby MC... "Country Grammar", "EI" , practically the whole entire release showcase that...however on "Luven Me" Nelly actually has LYRICS sorta except he gets lost in his own barage of words after the first verse... So all in all -- this cd doesn't deserve even 1 star -- Nelly shows us his preschool IQ -- and for those who are lost in hiphop and are on the quest to hear talented artists : check out Common, The Roots, Talib Kweli, Pharoahe Monch, Gangstarr, Hieroglyphics, etc... those are the cats who still and always will keep it real and they contribute a braincell to their work... 
A10DNCYK7YISHU B00000IAD5 February 23, 2001 6 6 5.0 One of the best hiphop CDs ever made... If your looking for relief from the 100% fake commercial rappers or are an underground head already and just want to hear some lesser known artists... this the the perfect treat for you. Rawkus really did a good job on this, its one of their landmark CDs along with both Soundbombing CDs. Believe it or not but this is a double CD that's excellent on both discs! I can't decide which side is better! De La Soul hosts the first disc, and Sir Menelik does the 2nd...highlights on both discs are: Cypher Complete's "Bring Hiphop Back" which is hauntingly exactly what we all need, Mos Def's smooth "Body Rock" , "Bathroom Cypher" lets us hear some no-name hungry mcs, the 10 minute track with Common - Black Thought - Pharoahe Monch - and newcomer Absolute freestyling , "Mayday" from Natural Elements , Talib Kweli's rules of hiphop on "Manifesto" , the dope a$$ flow from A.L. all over "Lyrics" , J5's fun wordplay on "Jayou", and Last Emperor's verse on "CIA"... but don't think the rest of the tracks don't live up to the mentioned ones, their all excellent too... I'm just stating which one really really impressive... Another essencial album for your collection...skip over Vol 2 that was a very dissapointing sequel.. 
A10DNCYK7YISHU B00000053T December 14, 2000 2 2 4.0 Another awesome ATCQ release... The groups 3 previous releases, yes I will agree don't allow this LP to fit in their usual sound...but even though Tribe decided to leave their own separate universe and join Earth and rap about actual youth topics, it still deserves it's credit... this is also a more commercialized side of ATCQ, but they have the talent to make it sound good... Throw in some of Tip's hypnotical toned voice, some of Phife's new evolved battle rap ability, and Ali Shaheed's excellent music display and you have yet another great ATCQ album... highlights of this cd were ... "Phony Rappers" , "Motivators" , "1nce Again" , "Mind Power" , "The Hop" , "Keeping It Moving" , "Word Play" , and "Stressed Out"... there aren't really any negative sides to the CD just except the part after Jam where Tip curses in every sentence...that's the only negative bitterness on the cd....other than that check it out if your a true hiphop head... 
A10DRJL3NJ4NCC B0000024ZO March 22, 2006 1 1 5.0 YES!!! If you hear the song YES in the original cast album 70 GIRLS 70 you might not even notice the song. It's magical to see how Liza transforms this song into a classical number. And that is just the opening number of this legendary concert you are guarantee to enjoy the rest of the show. 
A10DRJL3NJ4NCC B000063V8G October 11, 2002 2 3 1.0 Don't expect too many villians! Apart from a few brief moments you won't see any of the classic villians. I am glad I got the VHS frist to check out the what I am going to see before I buy the DVD.I can tell you I feel so cheated that I am sure there won't be any Mickey's Mouse House of Villians DVD on my shelf. 
A10DRJL3NJ4NCC B00005LKIA February 7, 2002 9 11 3.0 Theses Fantastic Legends To the point : You will be lucky if you can look as good as these broads do when you get to their age. It's great to see these ladies on the screen again. But don't expect another great story, such as Postcards From The Edge. Just to see Shirley, Debbie, Joan and Elizabeth is worth buying the tape. 
A10DRJL3NJ4NCC B00000K0DN January 8, 2002 5 8 1.0 Did nothing for me. To the point - After making this film, Joan made Berserk and Trog before she moved on to tv films.'I saw what you did' is pretty horrible film with a flimsy story line.The only saving grace is the brief moments of Joan,still glamous and every inch a STAR. from an audience point of view ... 
A10E139NRMGOMM B0000024W3 July 30, 2001 5 7 5.0 Time tested, music of Americana Here we are in the year 2001. Thirty years ago I purchased this album in that black plastic format that my son asks me "how do you play this thing, Dad?". I have since picked it up in CD format. Now I observe a quickening of artists vibrating in unison to music of "Americana". The fiddle playing hand in hand with the harmonica and banjo, pouring out tunes transplanted form Ireland and England that made appalachia so famous. Bob was into this over thirty years ago, and Self Portrait is his testimony to it. Ive heard a lot of whining about this collection of songs, and Ive also heard a lot of praise. Yes, a bunch of this music Bob did not write, but to sit and listen will give you an earfull of what is now in the year 2001 being refreshed musically. "All the tired horses" can hypnotize you into the correct mood for listening to this collection and "Wigwam" will keep the mood going for some time. "The Boxer" is Dylans version of a popular tune of the time, done in a very nice country format. "Copper Kettle", the moonshiners ballad, can stir up images of an illicit trade that supported many an applachian family during very hard times. "Little Sadie" and "Minstrel Boy" are two tunes that to this day amaze me with their cleverness. Bob continues to amaze me in his inspiration and creativity in this, one of my favorite Dylan collectons. 
A10E6601XCCSK2 B00008WFW5 January 2, 2004 4 4 5.0 Great innovation from BRIO The new SkyTrain series from Brio is a great idea that will add new possibilities to an existing track layout. This set should be the starting point if you wish to add SkyTrain to your collection. It contains five low and five high supports to carry the 10 included track pieces as well as two passenger wagons to drive around the track. It also contains a couple of trees for your Brio landscape. As always, it is a good idea to get some of the other SkyTrain accessories if you want more playability value from the set. For our SkyTrain set we have purchased 20 additional supports and the load/unload crane. The many supports make it fun to create advanced layouts running above and integrating with our traditional Brio layout. We are now looking forward to the battery-driven SkyTrain engine that Brio has announced for late-2003/early-2004. 
A10E6601XCCSK2 B00004T1C8 January 11, 2003 4 4 4.0 A nice addition to your Brio railway This tunnel generates one of four sounds when the train passes through or the button on the top is pressed. The sounds are well made. They include an owl sound, train and mine sounds and so forth. I think the playback volume is just right. A nice touch is the steps made on one side of the mountain as well as the small bridge on the top. These features creates a roleplay area for your child to explore with the small Brio men and women you can get in some of the other Brio sets. 
A10EBAP0TYPDTD B000002OSK September 2, 2005 4 4 5.0 Superlative, Superlative, Superlative. I have admired Mr. Hendrix since I was a boy of about 12 and first heard "Purple Haze" on the radio and my mother screamed "Turn that goddam thing off!" Right then, I knew he was the man. I bet when your mother yelled at you for playing Hendrix, you knew, too. Imagine my surprise when I was browsing through the discount bin at Tower Records and saw this unfamiliar multi-colored CD. I had never heard about it when it was released and thought it must be covers of Hendrix tunes by other bluesmen (or something like that). "Hendrix, eh?" I wondered. "It'll be worth a listen." How often it is that great things come from trivial encounters. So it was here. This is the single best Hendrix album I have ever listened to. There may be a couple of individual Hendrix tunes that I like better than the best of this album. But as a whole, this is it. Hendrix rocks freely and enthusiastically on every single tune in the whole album the way that no other human -- living or dead -- can. What a find. What an incredible find. What a superlative collection of loud, bluesy, funk-ridden, emphatic and edgy blues improvisation. I give it an unqualified five stars. 
A10EBAP0TYPDTD 080780746X March 22, 2000 16 18 5.0 Premier History of Outer Banks Region This is the premier history of the Outer Banks area, written by the region's premier historian. It begins in the 16th Century, when European explorers first touched the sandy barrier islands. It carefully traces the course of human and environmental events through the modern era, with special emphasis on the Revolutionary War and Civil War. This is a truly remarkable piece of work that will enlighten anyone interested in Carolina history. 
A10EBAP0TYPDTD B000031KFL January 18, 2000 1 3 5.0 Go, girl! Ms. Prankster has proven to herself and the world that she is not a wacky one-CD wonder. She is a superb musician and a way funny lyricist. She smiles coyly as she sings on topics from Mata Hari's men to her years in the Anne Arundel County public school system. And she lets her guitar do her talking. You Rock, Sister. 
A10EBAP0TYPDTD B000002J0L February 16, 1999 1 1 5.0 A crisp snapshot of what mattered to young guys 25 years ago When I spin this album, I close my eyes and I see a scene from 25 years ago, that I sometimes wish I could revisit: several happy and stoned guys sitting in dorm room, laughing, talking and oh-so-sure their friendship and their youth would last forever. 
A10EEPCU4SZO06 B000058AK1 February 26, 2003 5 5 5.0 Nicest set I have ever owned This is a beautiful set of pans - all you would ever need in a kitchen to make a meal and then some. They are well-made, cook food beautifully, steam vegetables, and are lovely to hold and show off. I have enjoyed them immensely since the day I got them 
A10EEPCU4SZO06 0345414349 September 11, 2001 4 5 5.0 Wonderful writing and thought provoking A wonderful view of the world without all the gadgets we think are necessary. A great way to live and belong in the world. As a Christian I think we could do without alot of the junk the world thinks we need. Thanks for a great book. 
A10EN9IKKOEY97 B00009X6DT January 27, 2005 0 1 5.0 Whats all the fuss about? I was sort of reluctant to buy this product, based on all the poor reviews here at amazon.com. I bought it anyways, mostly because its my only option to be able to play online. When i got it, i was really wondering where everybody was having all the trouble. It was one of the easiest setups i have done to be completely honest with you, and it works like a charm. Take my word for it, and i am by no means a computer genious. It comes with a startup disc that walks you through every possible step. Simple as that! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! 
A10EN9IKKOEY97 B00005UOS4 January 23, 2005 9 14 3.0 Terrible screen, not worth the 150 bucks... I absolutely HATE this screen. It is so tiny, that you cant even see anything barely. I play sports games mainly, but on this screen its nearly impossible to play because you cant see anything. NOT WORTH 150 BUCKS AT ALL!!! There is another option out there that i will tell you about here...Go to best buy, or another electronics company, and buy a power inverter. i have a JENSEN brand 300 watt inverter. It plugs straight into your cigarette lighter spot in the car. Then, if you have a small kitchen tv that some people have, or about a 13 inch tv, you can plug that into the inverter, and have a full sized tv in the back of your car or whereever you want. Defintittely the better option, worth the money...i think the inverter is the same cost as the piece of crap screen. 
A10EN9IKKOEY97 B00007KDVI January 22, 2005 0 0 4.0 Good router This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it. It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up. By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do. It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is. That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual. It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house. There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it. I do not really know why some people are tearing this router apart on their reviews, they are talking about installation problems and what not. Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!! 
A10ETSMF2H8QG2 B000056HKA April 7, 2002 3 3 4.0 Working great for us! We purchased these moniters because it comes with 2 receivers. We are currently taking care of my husbands mother and she is living upstairs, while we are living in our mostly finished basement. We keep the moniter upstairs so when his mother is playing with our daughter we can tell if she needs any help and can hear if the baby is crying (Our baby sleeps in a corner of our bedroom so we only use them for checking in upstairs). We keep one receiver in the bedroom downstairs and the other in the computer room downstairs (where my husband always is working). We both wake pretty easily so the moniters 'white noise' is not a problem for us, we can keep the moniters fairly low & still be able to hear her loud & clear. We are very happy with these moniters & would definetly recommend them to others. 
A10EW5N83RTO27 0061124230 May 17, 2006 11 34 2.0 The forest or the trees? Brinkley has demonstrated great ability in his research and writing, in his sympathetic imagination and his judgments. However the book is almost impossible to read: too much detail, too many individuals and their stories, too much unavoidable repetition. There is almost too much information from which to draw any conclusions, except the obvious ones: 1. At all levels government failed, but the higher the authority the more monumental the failure. 2. New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were a disaster just waiting for Katrina, geographically, demographically, socially, and culturally. 3. The rebuilding of the damaged remains should proceed only when and if enough funds are really available for a proper reconstruction which would make another disaster virtually impossible. 4. Even without Katrina, this part of the country was rotten to the core and would have collapsed of its own weight eventually. Katrina hastened that process. New Orleans is the monumental underside of America: a third-world tribal African country hidden by Ptomekin-like facades. Probably Prof. Brinkley was too concerned with getting a best-seller out. I don't resent this -- he deserves the acclaim. But real history cannot yet be written on this topic. It will, when written, not be about water and sickness, levees and bridges. It will be about what is wrong with America in the Age of Bush. 
A10EW5N83RTO27 0195057821 August 22, 2000 3 4 4.0 more than you wanted to know An excellent analysis of what can be known about Hitler's mental and physical health. Along with books by Rosenbaum and Kershaw it provides probably all that we will ever know. The really difficult question is not why Hitler had such peculiar views and the will to put them into effect, the real question is why the most developed country in Europe, perhaps in the world, allowed this pathetic excuse for a human being to gain total control by more or less democratic means. Ian Kershaw so far provides the best insight into what was wrong with the Germans and what in Hitler appealed to them. It turns out that the Germans were to be sure odd -- they were "German" -- but not much odder than other peoples. One can say one doesn't think one's own people could support a Hitler but one cannot be sure. The attraction of evil remains the supreme puzzle. 
A10EW5N83RTO27 0300078803 September 26, 1999 15 41 5.0 Superb but will anyone believe it Apparently there is no amount of scholarship which will convinced the prejudiced. Kamen superbly shows how the number of victims of the Spanish Inquisition have been exaggerated to serve the cultural and religious interests of Jews, Protestants, liberals, haters of Spain, and so on. But the old views still prevail. One still reads in newspapers, for instance, that tens of thousands of Jews were killed by the Inquisition. Actually the Inquisition did not have authority over Jews. It killed, according to Kamen, about three Christians (real or crypto) every year from the early 16th century until its near demise at the end of the 18th century. It makes one sad to see that scholarship cannot overcome prejudice. Another area Kamen demolishes is the idea that vast numbers of Jews lived in Spain before 1492 and vast numbers left for other climes. Actually there were never very many Jews in Spain and in the 14th and 15th Century most became Christian. It seems to me that Spain demonstrates the right way to end religious chaos, by turning the screws on Jews to make them turn Christian. Eventually even crypto Jews became good Catholics. Had this been done with Spanish dedication elsewhere in Europe there would have been no Jewish problem for Hitler to exploit. 
A10EW5N83RTO27 037575895X January 10, 2006 3 4 1.0 The story of an old bore Having decided not to take third-year Latin in High School I always wondered if I had missed something. Cicero was the subject of third-year Latin. I needn't have worried. Cicero was, this book reveals, just as boring, self-serving, ridiculous, and irrelevant as I had always thought. His defense of Republicanism was reactionary and totally out of touch with what military success had made of Rome, an empire based on military rule. The feckless aristocrats whose cause he championed were among the most benighted and ridiculous pack of thieves in history. Caesar, whom Cicero opposed, was the only farsighted Roman leader. His death was a tragedy. Augustus, his grand nephew and first Roman "emperor" saved a good deal of Republican Rome but in the hands of his inferior successors the Empire became a pure despotism. Roman politics is enormously complicated in the Republican period and this book tries but fails to make it more understandable. Better read Suetonius, who had a sense of humor and a pornographic streak. Cicero remains one of the most overrated authors in history. Rarely did he have an original thought. He was a wheeler-dealer and ultimately failed in all his endeavors. 
A10EW5N83RTO27 1587430169 October 11, 2005 1 4 1.0 what nonsense is theology! The entire enterprise of theology -- attempting to explain a God whom even religion notes is beyond understanding -- is by definition ridiculous and nonsense! What to say here? Simply this. The argument of Barth and Hauerwas against natural theology is simply a way of making irrational religion impervious to rational critique. If you start by saying that Christianity is not based on nature, then what is it based on? Barth/Hauerwas would say revelation. But revelation is simply the delusion of old Jews and Greeks, who had no more notion of what God was or might be than the man in the moon. Thus revelation is baloney and so is Hauerwas and even Barth, for all Barth's intellectual distinction. It is time to call a spade a spade: theology is nonsense. 
A10EW5N83RTO27 0099448440 April 27, 2005 6 6 5.0 Almost everything you wanted to know about Eichmann...... But were afraid to ask. Well, almost everything. David Cesarani specializes in thoroughly researched biography (see his fulsome, almost too much so, book on Arthur Koestler) and here you find everything about Eichmann's background and career, except a definitive explanation of why he did what he did and was what he was. Here is a good refutation of Hannah Arendt's Eichmann who was just a dimwitted cog in the genocidal wheel of the Nazis. The real Eichmann freely made career choices which slowly but surely made him an effective executive participant in the murder of Europe's Jews during the Second World War. Was he a convinced anti-semite or only a career opportunist? Hard to say, but certainly the Austrian Protestant milieu in which he grew up contributed to his willingness to become a genocidal expert. He had none of the Austrian Catholic Schamperei which while negative about the Jews was never efficient enough to do more than create unpleasantness for them. Eichmann was more disciplined, more determined, and more effective. Like many other careerists in the Third Reich it was enough to know that enthusiasm and initiative in the war against the Jews would be rewarded by higher officials in tune with Hitler's ultimate desires and urges. There was nothing "banal" about Eichmann's activities or beliefs but he was not unusual either, one of hundreds of thousands of officials, teachers, clergy, military, and professionals who found the Hitler regime open to their expertise in the solving of problems. Eichmann was good at transportation problems and their solution, whether the commodity in question was grain, shoes, or living Jews. He knew how to get them to Riga or Minsk or Auschwitz where they would be shot or gassed in accorance with his instructions from Heydrich and Himmler. This is a book well worth reading and pondering. Perhaps not just anyone but certainly a rather large number of Americans could become Eichmanns under the right circumstances. 
A10EW5N83RTO27 1400040949 August 26, 2004 43 51 5.0 The ABC of Fascism This book admirably summarizes a vast literature on Fascism and highlights a few key points which can be kept in mind when the threat of Fascism is imagined or raised. 1. Fascism cannot be understood only from its ideologues, it needs to be looked at in practice. 2. The practice of Fascism, as indeed the rise to power of Fascism, requires collaboration and support from the much older, stronger, and more respectable conservative and establishmentarian foundations of any society. 3. Because Fascism is designed to prevent leftist revolution it is profoundly conservative, but because its means are radical it cannot really remain conservative in practice. 4. Because Fascism is conservative it does not require much in the way of terror, intimidation, or violence to capture the acquiescence and cooperation of large segments of society, particularly of "respectable" society. It does its evil under the cover of the good and the conventional. 5. Therefore Fascism's evil can be hard to discover until it is too late. Paxton also provides a list of the "mobilizing passions" of Fascism which can be looked for in any society. It is here that one can in contemporary America, for example, analyze the ranting and raving of talk-show hosts, the unconventional and radical goals of foreign policy experts, the manipulation of patriotic appeals, and the apocalyptic appeals of popular religiosity to discover whether Fascism has entered the national life or not. The Fascist label can be used indiscriminately and falsely, but it is possible that at the present time it ought to be used more insightfully. But it ought indeed to be used! 
A10EW5N83RTO27 0300095694 January 18, 2004 9 18 4.0 Federalism and Nationalism in East Slavic lands In some ways this is a marvellous book, dealing with the life and death of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and with the states which succeeded it. This Republic of nobles and gentry has often been ridiculed for its weaknesses and its inability to resist its more powerful neighbors, but as long as it lasted there was more freedom, religious, political, and social, within its borders than anywhere else in Europe. It was not only the powerful empires of Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary which did it in; it was also destroyed by the growth of nationalism, the idea that a state should be more or less the same as a nation. Snyder shows with devastating irony how artificial nationalist ideologies really are, but also how powerful they can become and how deadly. Certainly the world of Eastern Europe would have been better under the inspiration of the great "Lithuanian" poet Adam Mickiewicz and the last great Polish politician Josef Pilsudski, but this was not to be. Snyder, however, closes his book on what can only be called Polish propaganda, that is the claim that the Poles, of all the East Slavic and Baltic peoples, have learned the lessons of history. Many would dispute this. He attributes far too much to the role of the Poles in preventing hostilities at the end of Soviet rule from degenerating into Yugoslavian civil war. Thus a very fine historical analysis ends on a weak and a false note. But you would have to go far to find a better history of ethnic conflict and accomodation in Eastern Europe. You might have to go to the potboiler novels of Polish history of Henryk Sienkiewicz (the author also of Quo Vadis)but I don't recommend this. They will bore you to death. Snyder should take his publisher to task for many errors in grammar and punctuation and for mere carelessly. Yale University Press did a good job getting Polish, Ukrainian, and Baltic names spelled correctly (no mean trick) but it seems to have had some problem with simple English. 
A10EW5N83RTO27 0060185163 May 30, 2003 7 13 3.0 Somewhat Useful But Not Too Much This is for anyone familiar with the England of James I and his immediate predecessors a disappointment. But perhaps I should have paid attention to the title, God's Secretaries. The Book is about this strange group of men who retranslated the Tyndale Bible but actually made only small changes. It does not deal with a much more important issue, exactly how decisions on translation were made, but the source material is lacking here. The chief attraction then and now of this particular Bible translation is that it is understandable enough for those wanting the meaning of the Scriptures but archaic enough for aesthetic needs and inspiration. 
A10EW5N83RTO27 0465024645 July 28, 2001 4 8 5.0 FDR: worse than we ever thought! This book is what we Roosevelt haters have longed for for half a century. No hater of "that man in the White House" and his awful wife could have thought in fantasy half as much as Thomas Fleming demonstrates in fact. This book should be required reading for all liberals, Democrats, and leftists, and for all Jews I would recommend mandatory reading or a period of mandatory community service if they refused! Jews in America think FDR saved them from Hitler. In fact he prolonged Hitler's reign long enough to allow him to finish off the Jews he had not yet begun to kill in massive numbers. Without FDR, as without Woodrow Wilson, the 20th Century would have been less violent and less disastrous. And what about poor Joseph McCarthy? He was only a couple of years out of date! Fleming shows that there were over 300 Communist spies in the New Deal administration working directly for Stalin, unknown to FDR but clear evidence that FDR & Co. were themselves security risks. 
A10F2OC6Q0P3HY B00000DBT5 March 7, 2001 3 3 3.0 Good Live Album Spoiled By Poor Vocals This is a good live album let down by one crucial fact - Steve Walsh's once golden vocals have deteriorated badly, so much so that he can't even hit the notes in his own songs any more. And this really detracts from what is a decent live album and one much better than the album the concert was meant to promote - In The Spirit Of Things (see my review on this site). As it stands the album is far superior to the awful Live At The Whisky and features an overall performance far in excess of that. If you want to hear what Walsh and Kansas were once capable of spend your money on the truly incredible Two For The Show - which I called the best live album of all time in my review on this site. Unlike Live At The Whisky this album is worth your money and it contains decent live versions of some of the only good songs from In The Spirit Of Things. Recommendation to buy. 
A10F2OC6Q0P3HY B0000025B5 February 28, 2001 0 0 5.0 A Kansas Classic This, along with Leftoverture, is probably Kansas best known and best album - and not without due reason. Picking up where they left off in Leftoverture Kansas penned another album full of brilliant tracks with the classic Dust In The Wind Standing out as an all time classic. Other brilliant songs are Closet Chronicles and Portrait both of which maintain the creative spirit and superbly creative musicianship of the previous album. The weakest track is the last, Helplessly Human, but even then its still decent and can't really detract from the overall experience. This is an album all rock fans should own, not just Kansas fans. 
A10F2RGD2D36ZI 0803293364 March 25, 2006 0 0 5.0 A Chinese Horatio Alger This memoir is simply great story telling, a Chinese Horatio Alger tale where pluck and luck win out in the end. (Shen admits his admiration for Stendal's The Red and the Black and Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography, but it would be ungracious to push the analogies too closely.) For some reason Chinese culture permits a more casual, even humorous, treatment of the inhumanity and stupidity of the man-centered ideological system profiled here. If Shen's memoir doesn't have the moral weight of say, something by Solzhenitsyn, it's at least more enjoyable reading. Hats off to Shen, who (like Jacob Riis at the beginning of the twentieth century) can write so vigorously in a second language! 
A10F2RGD2D36ZI 0826207855 October 15, 2005 1 2 4.0 A good introduction to Carver A good introduction to Carver, who was a man of charm and impracticality, intensity and feminine tenderness, humility and immense ego, and who was simultaneously devoted to Christian orthodoxy and an ideosyncratic strain of nature mysticism. Kremer's introduction is nicely written and strikes a proper balance between hero-worship and debunking. Despite the black scientist's unusual combination of personality traits, his virtues and faults remained largely constant throughout his career, so some of Kremer's examples seem repetitious. That's no problem. In books like this one, you can skip and skim in good conscience. 
A10F2RGD2D36ZI 0851514510 February 25, 2005 5 5 4.0 The best introduction to Spurgeon for the general reader Arnold Dallimore (1911-1998), a Baptist clergyman who pastored three Ontario churches, also wrote biographies of Whitefield, Wesley, and Edward Irving. Like those biographies, this one of Spurgeon is intended to be both inspirational and historically accurate. The difficulties of simultaneously attempting to promote the faith while providing a "warts-and-all" biography are obvious, but Dallimore handles the challenge well. Dallimore, the Baptist pastor, emphasizes a Spurgeon who was a whirlwind of pastoral commitments, a hearty Calvinist who supervised a magnificent range of church-oriented social service activities. (To an agnostic he once retorted, "The God who answereth by Orphanages, Let Him Be God.") No wonder that after spending nearly forty years in the pulpit, Spurgeon died before he was sixty. Dallimore also properly stresses Spurgeon's principled withdrawal from the Baptist Union, with all the hurtful criticism that that decision engendered--as well as its prophetic anticipation of religious decline in the twentieth century. Yet it is also heartening to read of Spurgeon's warm relationship with those other evangelical giants of the late nineteenth century, D. L. Moody and Hudson Taylor, who didn't always cross their "t's" the same way as the London Baptist. I would have preferred a bit more on Spurgeon's theology, the historic setting in which his ministry developed, and the contrast between his periods of deep depression and his reputation as a "bubbling fountain of humor." Nevertheless, for the modern general reader, this life of Charles Haddon Spurgeon is perhaps the best introduction to the greatest of all nineteenth-century evangelical preachers . 
A10F2RGD2D36ZI 0870494252 January 3, 2005 1 1 4.0 Competent military history This competent military history of the Chattanooga campaign is organized in a supremely logical fashion, and its literary merit is above average if no challenge to Bruce Catton or James McPherson. McDonough occasionally seems puzzled by emotions that the war generated, and his attempts to humanize the campaign are sometimes lame. For instance, he treats professed reliance upon God as a sign of weakness. 
A10F2RGD2D36ZI 0452284023 August 16, 2004 3 5 3.0 More editing and deeper analysis needed Simon Worrall once more retells the remarkable story of master forger and sociopath Mark Hofmann. A facile popular treatment--there is no index--the book also includes loosely connected chapters on Emily Dickinson, the history of forgery, and the questionable ethics of major auction houses. Nevertheless, Worrall needs better editing. Not only does he repeat himself, he also makes a number of small errors about Mormon history and practice. If Worrall believes, as I do, that Joseph Smith was a fake, fraud, and sex addict, then he might have increased his credibility with more judicious language and more careful checking of his facts. Furthermore, Worrall might better have tied Emily Dickinson's fist-shaking against God with Hofmann's using any number of quotes from the teenage Dickinson to draw parallels with Hofmann's rebellion against Mormonism during the same period of his life. (For instance, the fifteen-year-old Dickinson wrote, "The world allured me & in an unguarded moment I listened to her siren voice. From that moment I seemed to lose interest in heavenly things.... I felt my danger & was alarmed, but I had rambled too far to return & ever since my heart has been growing harder." Fortunately, Dickinson was not attracted to forgery or explosives.) Finally, after hypothesizing that Hofmann was largely motivated to commit his crimes by his enmity against the LDS Church, Worrall should have examined the extent to which the Hofmann forgeries damaged Mormonism. Such a conclusion would have been more satisfying than Worrall's retailing of self-serving statements by Hofmann's ex-wife or his attempt to turn Amherst curator Daniel Lombardo into the tale's hero. 
A10F8ANXHL4X9Q 0860915468 August 7, 2002 5 7 4.0 Important book This is an excellent book for understanding the present "state" (no pun intended) of the world. Why is the globe chopped up into these seemingly arbitrary political units?, is Anderson's question. How can one make sense of nationalism and its development throughout the world in the last few hundred years? Anderson's reliance on "print capitalism" and the literate class (elite and educated bourgeois) as the predominant community to imagine itself seems limited to me. The politically dominant group's use of nationalism as a reinforcement of power structures, or in order to re-form power structures in the case of revolution and resistance, in Anderson's argument, developed through a widespread choice of language and access to information within that language group. Religious affiliations, and ethnic communities shaped not only through spoken/written languages in the pre-capitalist period were gradually replaced by nationalistic groups developed through colonialist projects. If you read this book, you will open your eyes to the present reality of nationalism, which is now being contradicted by the rise of super-national constituencies based on religious affiliation. Almost a step backward to feudalism, and I await Anderson's next book and some illuminating theory on recent world conflicts. 
A10FBJXMQPI0LL B00030590I May 30, 2005 1 1 5.0 A struggle to hit 5 stars, but better than 4. . . If you liked Crouching Tiger ~ If you liked House of Flying Daggers ~ If you are a fan of historical fiction ~ If you enjoy nuveau Kung-fu flicks ~ If you enjoy old-veau (get it?) Kung-fu flicks ~ Then you'll love this movie. Visually stunning - great story - super fight scenes (that actually have something to do with the story) - AMAZING costumes. That's all I've got for you. 
A10FBJXMQPI0LL B00009TB5G May 7, 2004 0 1 5.0 Mmmmm, gooood. You want to read aaaaaaall about the movie and it's long strides and short comings? Read all the other reviews. You want to know if this is a fantastic movie that, regardless of critical comparison to the books, is worth watching? Read below. Yes. Movie good. You watch. 
A10FBJXMQPI0LL 0876059981 January 29, 2001 32 33 5.0 Every so often a book comes along that just WOWs you. This is the WOW book to which the title refers. . . It is, for lack of a better description, "everything you need it to be". As a Clinical Massage Therapist I have become accustomed to dealing with physicians and their patients. . . When I got a call from a VET I was, well, taken aback. Having been a CCMT for many years, I knew what to expect and where to find problems in a HUMAN, but this book filled in absolutely every gap I could have come up with in regards to equine physiology, anatomy, kinesiology and the basics of "don't do this around a horse if you want to make it to your next patient" . . . To start off with, it's spiral bound so it's super easy to take to the stable! The illustrations are terrific and the text doesn't speak to you like you're a fifth grader; it assumes that if you're working on horses, you at least know the basics of working on humans. And finally, it's encouraging. . . It let's you know some of the pitfalls before they happen and how to avoid them. I'm really glad I picked this one up! I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in Equine Massage! 
A10FBJXMQPI0LL B00000IC7Z January 3, 2001 28 30 1.0 What a shame and a waste. . . As valuable as many of our "heritage films" have proven themselves to be, it's a real crime to allow a second (or in this case, THIRD) rate video producer to get their hands on them. Both "Midnight" (later released as "Call it Murder") and "Beat the Devil" as decent films in their own right, but this compilation DVD just needs to be burned, or at least banned. Compilations like this one are just another reason our appreciation of older films is in decay. I wouldn't drive a 58 Corvette if it were in this condition, I'm certainly not going to recommend such poor quality DVD reproductions of great movies. The video is aweful. The audio lags. Practically no special features. I STRONGLY URGE YOU NOT TO BUY THIS DVD OR ANY BY THE SAME COMPANY- 
A10FBJXMQPI0LL 0767018907 December 28, 2000 8 20 5.0 DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. . . BUY IT! BUY IT NOW! DON'T THINK! BUY! THIS IS **MONTHY PYTHON** DO YOU REQUIRE MEDICATION TO MAKE DECISIONS?!? YOU'RE STILL READING! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!? STOP READING NOW! TAKE YOUR MEDICATION, HIT "ONE-CLICK" AND GO TO BED! 
A10FBJXMQPI0LL B00004UFRD December 7, 2000 9 11 4.0 Think "Driver" meets "Vigilante 8" Think "Driver" meets "Vigilante 8" and you've got a pretty good idea of how this game works. The excitememnt and high speed chases of (a wilderness) "Driver" and the crash em' up "what's physics got to do with it" of "V-8". This is a really impressive piece of work; here's why: SIZE. . . The maps are MASSIVE. . . They seem to go on forever, and for the first half hour of play I thought that they wrapped around like in the old Atari days. . . Nope, they're just really flippin' huge! It could litterally take you 10 minutes to get from one side to the other. Want to climb a mountain? You can, and then you can look around at things that will actually take time to get to. . . DETAIL. . . Everywhere you look, theres just lots of, well, STUFF. You hit a stream and it goes on and on and on. . . You hit the highway and it stretches out for miles. . . You hit a pedestrian and, well, I don't want to spoil everything. PRICE. . . I've paid almost this much for PS1 games in the past that have still only been played for 15 minutes. This is one of those that, even if you don't play the mission mode, you will continue to pull out every few days and just allow yourself to be impressed by a video game. Why 4 stars and not 5? It's not perfect. The physics is a little conservative for me. Mind you, I'm not complaining. I'd have given up looooong ago if I actually died every time I deserved to in this game. Also, I don't like the fact that just about all the cars have the same acceleration and $X$ ability, even if they wouldn't have the ability in reality. But this isn't reality, it's pure, unadulterated fantasy, and it's WELL worth the price! 
A10FBJXMQPI0LL B000003913 May 29, 1999 7 7 5.0 One of my all time favorite albums! My CD collection is nearing the 1,000 mark, but there are a few discs that you can almost always find in my car or at my work. . . This is one of them. I'm not a big DEAD fan (don't hurt me), but Garcia and Grisman really struck a chord with me on this album. It was originally given to me by a friend that REALLY didn't like folk music and bought it because Garcia's name was on it. What a great album to get!! All the songs are SUPER tastefully done, but as the title implies, adults will enjoy these tunes as much as anyone! Really groovin' little disc! 
A10FD8EJ8CSJK0 B00000K4YU August 26, 2004 1 1 3.0 not the best, but worth watching for Jason Brooks! I am a fan of Jason, what can I say? Have you seen him in 'Days'? He's awesome, and while in this movie he doesn't get to exercise his acting skills too much, I think you will still find it entertaining. The actor who played his brother was a joy to watch...he almost stole the show...I was quite impressed! The plot is imperfect but what plot isn't. Screenplay writers have so many people to answer to. The special effects were completely low-tech but fun. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, and I wasn't expecting much seeing that this is Sci-fi. I give it 3 stars because with a little more work, it could have been great. 
A10FD8EJ8CSJK0 B0000560XD January 18, 2001 6 9 3.0 An entertaining sci-fi thriller. Rob Estes plays a cop who is unknowingly the real Nostradamus, and ends up having to save the world from Armageddon. The plotline of Nostradamus is slim but believable for the most part and the movie is both funny and thought-provoking. The swift movement of the action to the climax and conclusion also helps to make this a drama worth watching, providing an interesting twist to the Nostradamus legend. For all fans of Rob Estes from his "Silk" days, he is still as good as ever! 
A10GE0JR695QW0 0140195246 March 15, 2002 15 15 5.0 Find Your Creative Passion At 154 pages, this book is a short and an easy read. You can tell that the author is also a lecturer because the book seems like it makes a few basic points that could have been projected on a screen using PowerPoint slides. This book is not an intellectual analysis of data, but more like an inspirational pep talk. You are practically presented with an outline in each chapter, complete with bolded headings and sub-headings. This book is also filled with poignant quotes from notable people spanning the ages of history. This approach is appropriate and effective for this subject matter. The thesis of the book is simply find what taps into your creative passion in life and you will find the work you love. The book actually does give you a methodolgy to follow to uncover what at first seems to be an amorphous task. The "Focusing Questions" the author presents throughout the second half of the book is an opportunity for the reader to reflect and think about how this can make sense for him or her. The title of the book may be a little misleading. "Finding the work you love" is not referring to actually getting the job. The title is referring to finding within yourself what it is that you would love to do for your life's work. The audience for this book could be anyone from the high school or college graduate to the senior citizen. Anyone who is not sure what contribution they want to make for the rest of their lives might benefit from a bit of focused insight and reflection. Even if you are sure about what your life's work is, the book could still be valuable as a reinforcement that you are on the right path for you. 
A10GE0JR695QW0 0375708111 March 1, 2001 7 7 5.0 TOE - Theory of Everything Albert Einstein spent the last twenty years of his life attempting to formulate a unified Theory Of Everything (TOE). Although Einstein was unsuccessful, physicists may now have reached that goal. With the advantage of testing and measurements from particle accelerators and other advances in technology, modern day physicists finally have the tools that were not available to Einstein in his day. Modern physics rests upon two foundational pillars. Einstein's general theory of relativity provides a theoretical framework for understanding the macro universe of stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. Quantum mechanics provides a framework for understanding the micro universe of molecules, atoms and subatomic particles. These two theories have been experimentally confirmed, but are at the same time mutually incompatible as they are currently formulated. By substituting the attributes of subatomic particles as being one dimensional vibrating strings rather than as point-particle material constituents, the incompatibilities between quantum mechanics and general relativity are resolved. The warping of space and time, the constancy of the speed of light, the expanding universe, black holes and the time just before the big bang all concern general relativity. Planck's constant, wave lengths and frequency, and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle are the concerns of quantum mechanics. Calabi-Yau shapes, eleven dimensions (ten for space and one for time) and M-Theory all concern string theory. The quest for knowledge is a never ending journey not unlike our quest for enlightenment. 
A10GLKTPF3MMUM 0060081961 October 1, 2003 4 4 5.0 Classic Midwestern Character on Every Page Bob Greene captures the spirit of community and shared purpose endemic to the Midwestern United States. Mr. Greene is from Ohio and worked as a columnist at the Chicago Tribune. I too was raised in Michigan and Ohio, lived and worked in Chicago and travelled throughout the MidWest. I have lived in Boston for 20 years now and miss the sense of community of the Midwest captured in this book. (see also the book - "Bowling Alone" by Robert Putnam). Mr. Greene was fortunate to interview so many veterans of World War II. Many World War II veterans are passing away each day now and soon none will be around to interview. The nostalgia I felt while reading this book was not just nostalgia for a simpler time, for a World War cannot be a simpler time; but, for a time when sacrifice was shared among many and our communities watched over us. ajdjr73@earthlink.net 
A10GLKTPF3MMUM 0399146180 November 13, 2000 3 3 5.0 Hurray for Archy McNally and Vincent Lardo As expressed by other reviewers, I was devastated too by the death of Lawrence Sanders. I figured that would be the end of the detective books I have come to love. If you are a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, do not read these books. Gratuitous imbibing was part and parcel of Sander's genre and thankfully Vincent Lardo has tempered down all the boozing a little! Even Archy is trying to cut down on his English Ovals! I am very glad that Mr. Lardo has taken up this effort for those of us who enjoyed this light, tongue very well placed in cheek, series. This is light reading and the intention is too entertain completely which it does. Again, many thanks, Mr. Lardo. 
A10GYP3VXNM7X3 B0000009OI June 27, 2000 4 4 4.0 Rediscovery The overwhelming praise for this album written by Amazon reviewers caused me to dust off this disc and give it another spin. Through most of the nineties I ignored Sugar, in favor of good ole' Husker Du and Bob Mould solo when I needed a corn-fed buzz guitar fix. However, a fresh listen has brought me in agreement with the other reviewers of this recording. Copper Blue stands up to the best of the Husker catalog as well as his incredible solo albums. While I don't consider the album perfect - I find the radio-friendly "If I Can't Change Your Mind" slightly trite and "Man on the Moon" to be an arena-rock sing-a-long - I was brought to teeth-grinding euphoria from the power of the first four cuts. It worked me up so much that the reflective melodies of "Hoover Dam" were just the antidote to help me catch my breath for the relentless power of "The Slim". Thanks Amazon for helping me rediscover a treasure. 
A10GYP3VXNM7X3 B00000236B January 6, 2000 4 5 5.0 Listen to Dayton Ohio's top philosopher; bring a six pack Perhaps the number one job of an artist is to provide the public with a complete picture of themselves and the world they come into contact with. If that's the case, then Rob Pollard is a gem of an artist. Listen and learn what its like to be a school teacher dropout turned basement rock star from Dayton Ohio. A philosopher lubricated by American beer and cigarettes, Rob weaves complex metaphors about simple ideas. His band cranks out big hooks over walls of tape hiss and missed cues. By listening to a do-it-yourself rock star, you as a listener, can become a do-it-yourself revolter of the commercial music industry. You may even be inspired to quit your job or start strumming and writing lyric in your basement. My recommendation: buy the wax edition and dust off your turntable. 
A10H3VDEPW7QWI 0670887579 November 26, 1999 26 26 5.0 Roddy's Finest Hour A Star Called Henry is probably far more accurate in its portrayal of Ireland in the last years of British rule than many would realise. The activities of the members of Michael Collins' "Squad" were much like those performed by Henry Smart, who was, in the novel, on the periphery of possibly the most effective counter-intellegence agency in the world. Roddy Doyle's excellent novel captures the period as well as anything I have hitherto read on the subject. He captures the feeling of Dubliners towards the Easter Rising, before and after the executions, and the attitude of those beyond the Pale (English-controlled region around Dublin, where the phrase comes from) to the "jackeens". Henry's delay in leaving Ireland was, I believe, not as surprising as some seem to think. Henry had great loyalty towards Michael Collins, similar to his feelings towards James Connolly, a debt of honour, if you will, that kept him from abandoning him while that was unresolved. After his betrayal and the death of Collins, he was free to leave the country. These attributes are visible in the character of Henry Smart, and are a major influence on his actions. His various loyalties are strong and are probably the driving force of his life. Before A Star Called Henry, I wasn't much a fan of Roddy Doyle the author, preferring the film versions of the Barrytown Trilogy, but I await with anticipation the remaining books in his latest Trilogy. 
A10HCSEK3K3MWG 0895261022 August 9, 2004 10 10 5.0 Alarming You could be "Mugged by the War on Drugs" because the government wants to raise revenue. Fitzgerald quotes "Steven Kessler, who once headed the district attorney's asset forfeiture unit in the Bronx, New York. `The focus is no longer on combating crime. It's on fundraising.'" You could be "Mugged by Eminent Domain" because the government wants to take your property and give it to someone else. Fitzgerald explains their reasoning: "under the banner of `redevelopment,' many government officials now interpret public good to mean the advancement of any business interest that creates more jobs and tax revenue than the business, home, or neighborhood that it replaces." The author devotes his largest chapter to people "Mugged for the Environment." The remaining chapters cover government incursions into people's livelihoods in order to help the handicapped, maintain safe workplaces, and protect consumers. Victims lose property, years of their lives, and faith in justice. The bad guys are government officials enforcing unreasonable regulations either because they are drunk with power or the tools of third parties seeking to transfer property to themselves. The good guys are victims who fight to keep their property even if they only score Pyrric victories after lengthy and expensive legal battles. Good guys also include legal groups such as the Institute for Justice. Fitzgerald rejects the criticism that these tales are isolated. He claims that "It Could Happen to You." "I believe", he writes, "a strong case can be made that these anecdotes show the emergence of clear and disturbing patterns, and from these patterns we can discern systemic problems and abuses that require legislative remedies." In conclusion he outlines proposals for reform. Exercise your property rights to buy this book and prepare to be shocked. 
A10HHM2684NZD2 B0001L5NNC April 16, 2006 0 0 5.0 WOW!!!! Max is back! An amazing CD from start to finish. I was a HUGE fan of Sepultura back in the day but lost track of anyhting Max did after ROOTS. This is my first time listening to Soulfly (believe it or not) and i'm glad I picked it up! I love all the experimentation , sounds very fresh mixing all the world music styles together. THis is what I imagined what Sepultura would have sounded like if they were still together with Max today. I also love the HELMET cover of In the Meantime... just awsome! 
A10HHM2684NZD2 B0009W5JS2 July 29, 2005 2 6 1.0 Triple CORNEY! Wow, was this an action movie or a comedy? This was so bad I laughed through most of it! 
A10HHM2684NZD2 B0002VAKK2 April 28, 2005 2 5 2.0 REHASHED 80s METAL Did I just step into a time warp? It's fine and all to be into the old school metal. Hey I loved bands like Testiment and Anthrax back in the days, and dont forget the kings of metal...Iron Maiden! But trying to do what has been done by a million other bands before, and not as good, is just plain boring and just a rehash. Leave this type of metal in the 80s where it belongs. 2 stars because it reminds me of Testiment. 
A10HHM2684NZD2 B00006ADER April 14, 2005 1 1 5.0 I hate Football....I love this movie!! Not to bemoan the people of small town america but i'm glad I had the good fortune to grow up in a big city. Seeing the insane obession of people who live there lives for high school football is hilarous! If you love football and are from a small town, you'll root through the whole film, if you don't live in a small town and don't care for football, you'll chuckle through most of it. I recommend watching "Hands on a Hard Body" after seeing this, another great doc. 
A10HHM2684NZD2 B00004XMSC March 24, 2005 2 3 5.0 Cult Classic Cheese!!!!!!!!! Cmon! Just look at the DVD cover! If that alone doesnt make you laugh then nothing will! 
A10HHM2684NZD2 B0002IQ9VY March 8, 2005 0 0 5.0 BRILLIANT!! Being from Brooklyn I can't help but respect these guys. All of them are briliant musicians! Although this CD is more "radio"then their others, it shows another side of them that is new and refreshing. I mean, even the most die hard Canderia fan doesnt want to hear 100% Density all over again do they? And I read one reviewer say that rap is the most hated genra in metal? Well if your from Brooklyn and if you've seen these guys play in Brooklyn, especially in the early days, you'll know that there are just as many "Rap" guys that go to see their shows as so called "metal" guys. Enough of lables, this CD is 100% Canderia. Love it. 
A10HHM2684NZD2 B00009MEJP August 13, 2004 1 10 2.0 I fell asleep........ TWICE!! I love japanese film. I really wanted this to be good. Even though I liked the character development and the plot was ok I just couldnt get into this. I actually fell asleep.... twice! The camera work at times can be interesting but some scenes are way too drawn out without really going anywhere. The mood and pace of the film is very monotone and flatline, especially for a film that touts itself as being this grand rollercoaster ride. And in response to another reviewer here, Taranteno does take alot from asian cinema, but asian cinema borrows alot from western culture as well, at this point there is alot of equal give and take. If you want to see an interesting so called "cool" japanese film see Samurai Fiction instead. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 157673854X January 31, 2005 2 7 5.0 Poignant and Enlightening Book! The author shows a conversation that might have occurred between the two religious leaders. Of course Buddhists will not like the deep Christian convictions of Zacharias, but that is to be expected. Buddhists claim to have an open mind when discussing Christianity, but as proven by many a review, they are as closed-minded as I would expect them to be when they feel that their religion is not being exalted. We are all protective of our religion, and Zacharias is showing Christianity as the truth that it is in a world that says many paths to God are possible. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I B000008FB1 April 9, 2004 1 1 5.0 Vince Ebo's Christ-centered lyrics continue on Even after his death, Vince Ebo will bless you with this CD. The lyrics are deep, thought-provoking, and the music touches the soul! 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0840732201 February 25, 2004 3 3 5.0 Excellent for anyone trying to lose weight!! I lost over 30 pounds through the timely, sensible, and realistic advice from this book! I love the Minirth-Meijer workbooks and this one is highly recommended! 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0800631862 January 12, 2004 12 22 4.0 As the Christian daughter of a lesbian... I can safely say that this book makes an honest effort to approach the subject kindly and treat homosexuals in a loving way. I do not agree that homosexuality is just another lifestyle. I have watched my own mother go from lover to lover, never satisfied. She has had at least 13 lesbian partners in the past 14 years. She has finally found a woman that she is content to stay with but she is just that, "content," not necessarily happy. She left the church years ago and has no use for religion, but she and I get along beautifully. We have learned to love in spite of our opposing views on her sexuality. I love my Mom and I know that the environment she was raised in was one of maternal loss (her mother died when she was 18 months old), profound loneliness, and verbal abuse from an unaccepting, often cruel grandmother. Jesus encouraged compassion for every mortal, lesbian or straight, conservative or liberal. I leave the judging part to Him. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0805066438 November 17, 2003 3 12 2.0 Some good insights but nothing real original. The basis of this book is great and the author has a terrific way with words but she loses the reader after about page 55, where she goes off into all sorts of liberal and unproven theories about modern family life. Her research was limited to one major American company and does not illuminate why there are so many problems in balancing work and family life. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0805035354 August 23, 2003 1 1 5.0 An Amazing, Shocking Journal of the Balkan Conflict! The man who wrote this book wrote from his heart, not merely his head. He gave insights that only a true 'survivor' of modern-day war could give. Beautifully written and powerfully emotional, this book is life-changing. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0810115905 July 9, 2003 3 8 5.0 An Inspired Classic! This book will absolutely challenge your political and spiritual ideas, no matter what they are! I was brought to my knees in gratitude for the freedom we have in America after finishing this book. A true miracle that it ever got published, with all the KGB attacks and threats. A MUST READ! 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 1878327631 March 24, 2003 4 4 5.0 This book changed my life dramatically!! I have never read a Christian book that so intimately showed me the path to peace. R.T. Kendall touched my heart and my life so deeply when he reminded me, through his book, that the life of every believer is lived by FAITH and faith alone. It is in believing God that we find direction and fulfillment. A better book about this life-changing subject would be hard to find. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0060988754 November 17, 2004 3 3 5.0 Encouraging to those of us who fiddle around a lot! This book helped me to realize my potential in simple areas rather than always striving to do the impossible every day and never achieving anything. It is far better to do one thing very well than to do a thousands things haplessly. This book's message is simple, direct, and very practical. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a strong motivational book that does not place unrealistic demands on the reader. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0140420150 November 5, 2004 4 5 5.0 One of the finest poets of his generation! I am a great fan of Hopkins. His work touches not merely the intellect, but the soul with its depth of insight and tenderness. There is a richness to his work that many of the poets who were his contemporaries lacked. There is faith, hope, love, and a respect for the universe and its Creator. Another beautiful Penguin Classic collection. Every library personal and public should have a copy. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0393051897 October 28, 2004 1 12 1.0 Rambles through the land of narcotics like a lost tourist... The author leads us to believe that prohibition of drugs in any form is a terrible idea and is the reason why so many people are getting rich off of the drug trade. His theory has many holes and though I understand what he is trying to say, I didn't like his Marxist-style commentary. He rambles through the first 5 chapters like a lost tourist and has some very foolish ideas on how to treat the drug epidemic. Not one of the better books on the subject of drug use and abuse. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 014043464X September 14, 2004 3 6 5.0 Charlotte Bronte's Friend & Fellow Author Writes Great! This book is a true classic along with all the books of the early to mid-1800's. The setting, the characters, the plot, and the intricate weaving of inspiration, spirituality, and passion is unforgettable in this classic work called "Mary Barton." A beautiful, touching account of life in England in the 1800's. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0520239288 August 31, 2004 1 2 5.0 An Unforgettable Spiritual Classic! John Donne's poetic words pierce the heart and ignite the imagination. He speaks food for the soul, not just the heart. I have read and re-read his books for many years and cannot tell how deeply they have moved me and inspired me to be a better Christian. He was a profound writer, almost mystical and yet so very down to earth. A beautiful book that should not be missed by anyone interested in the life of faith. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0375408908 July 24, 2004 5 22 3.0 Interesting Subject but Unoriginal Social Remedy The author has a fantastic ability to draw us into the lives of some of America's most destitute workers. He is very passionate about understanding their plight and offering them hope. Unfortunately, his plan of hope is to engage the government to place even more restrictions on private industry and tax them more than ever before. How in the world is that going to help things? That is exactly why so many of our jobs are leaving this country and heading to Asia, Europe, and even Africa. Companies cannot afford the enormous taxes and restrictions, certainly they can afford to pay American workers more than $6-7 per hour, but only if they are not required to meet every federal and state standard that's out there! Good book but the author forgets that companies are trying to make a profit in a society that punishes the rich and robs the poor. I have never earned more than $6 an hour, and though I hate this, I don't blame individual companies for it, I blame too much government involvement in the private affairs of businesses nationwide! 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0936077239 July 7, 2004 5 5 5.0 An Informative, Top-Notch Resource for Any Library! I struggled with bulimia for years and this book was one of several books which helped me on my road to recovery. The author is sensitive and cares deeply about men and women struggling with eating disorders and she delves deep into the causes as well as treatments. Another book that helped was the Minirth-Meier Clinic book on Eating Disorders. Fantastic resources for anyone dealing with this often deadly disease. 
A10HWJXUG67E7I 0849902622 April 29, 2004 0 0 5.0 An Amazing Testimonial to the Power of God! This book was so inspiring about the lives of seven Siberian/Russian Christians who faced horrible odds and survived to tell about it! God strengthened them during the horrors of Soviet oppression and KGB persecution. A thrilling account that will remind you of God's power and love. 
A10ID9TVD8SMEX 0689843917 January 30, 2002 0 0 5.0 A great early reader for your little girl or boy! I picked this up through a school book club for my 4-year-old daughter. She is quite a good reader at this point, and enjoys reading this book. It is written with easy to read language, but not to the point of being uninteresting for the child. I am especially pleased that the featured character, Wendy, is female. This is sadly lacking in many children's books. Look for "Dizzy's Bird Watch" for an equally great book. 
A10ID9TVD8SMEX B000059XI2 May 13, 2001 4 4 5.0 Great item! Must have! This is perfect storage and protection for my daughter's Leap Pad. It keeps everything neat and organized. You should get one if your child has a Leap pad! 
A10IJF7UD9I86G B00005J536 November 18, 2002 2 2 5.0 The series that started it all is back in stride My goodness! This has to best of the series edging out TM2 in my opinion. Very fast, handles great and has a *really* fun 4 man multiplayer. There are about 15 different characters(including Sweet Tooth!) and about 11 levels for single player and 18 for multiplayer, so there is alot variety. Some levels are compact and some aremassive, like the Suburbia level for example. Dont ask me how they did it, but they made this game run at an almost perfect 60fps at all times, even with realtime weather conditions on some levels with pouring rain and heavy snow. Thats unbelievable considering all the particle explosion effects, players and landscape this title shows all on screen at once, with no noticeable fog in the background......amazing. The Soundtrack is sweet. Its very dyanamic as well. For example, when there is alot of action on screen, the music will get louder and play more riffs, but for those couple quiet moments, the music will dim down a bit and make things peaceful. It adds so much to the game, espescially i you have a Dolby Surround sound system. The destruction and speed of this game compliments this series really well, taken to the next level with the better technology obviously. The particle effects are amazing and the maneuvers, handling and physics are extremely polished. It is a little difficult but not enough to get frustrated, well maybe sometimes, but definitely challenging. Thankfully there are cheats you can use if its gets too hard. The multiplayer is also a blast. 2 or 4 player splitscreen and stil runs at 60 fps most of the time, even in 4 player! I mean it, this is the most enjoyable multiplayer game I've played in a while. Lot of unlockables, CG stories for each character, short load times, very slick menus and sweet music. There's really nothing I can gripe about. This is THE best car combat game on the market. Again, welcome back Incognito, you made the TM series great once again. Buy it! 
A10J0362MO0RM3 B00005T30I November 2, 2001 4 4 5.0 Outstanding bittersweet drama "Les Enfants du paradis [The Children of Paradise]" is an incredible feast of sparkling dialog, interesting and unique characters, and simple truth within a sweet tragicomic fantasy about the world of theater. The story follows three men and the woman they love. Garance led a hard life when she was orphaned as a child and is kind to all but wise and independent of all attachments. She does not hope for love and is stronger than the men that love her. Baptiste Debureau, an extraordinary mime, is an artistic genius who loves simply and carries his pure-hearted empathy for his fellow humans into all his performances. Frederick Lemaitre is a grand actor with a courageous heart to match his skill on stage. Like Garance, he does not hope to love, but also like her, he falls victim to a bittersweet affection despite himself. My favorite character of all is the thief and murderer Lacenaire, who expresses a fierce admiration for truth and the exquisite ironies of life, despises society, has always known and loved Garance, and maintains a peculiar and noble dignity. Imagine a lucidity that enabled you to fully understand the world and your loved ones and then award yourself the tongue of an angel to express what you felt. That is what you find in Jacques Prevert's screenplay. See it now. Trust me. 
A10J0362MO0RM3 B00005M2C0 July 5, 2001 16 17 5.0 Luc Besson's first and one of his best "Le Dernier Combat" takes place in a grim post-apocalyptic future and is Luc Besson's first feature. Even though it won a lot of praise from critics, it has rarely if ever been available in the U.S. If you like Besson, read the history of this outstanding film and buy it. (Columbia will also be releasing a new edition of "Subway.") 
A10J3P588LGC0M 0595672752 August 15, 2005 5 5 5.0 Destined to be a classic! My wife just gave me a copy of Percussion Pistols and Revolvers for my birthday, and I found myself reading it straight through - what a fabulous present! Messrs. Cumpston and Bates really come through in their thorough, terrific book on percussion pistols and revolvers, with some of the best gun writing that has ever been my pleasure to read. Full of straightforward and brutally honest reviews of every major variant of percussion pistol, this book delighted me with unlooked-for nuggets of wonderful and fascinating historical info (one appendix is an entire dueling code!) and laugh-out-loud humor. Bates and Cumpston use plentiful detailed photographs and charts to supplement their rich but practical text on percussion handgun history, development, shooting, loads, chronography and hunting. I can't stress enough the enjoyment this book will provide any firearms enthusiast - I plan on buying a couple more copies to give to friends as Christmas gifts. I would give this six stars if I could! 
A10JLFG2LAAYDV 093965301X July 17, 2000 5 5 5.0 So much information, so little time This book is jam packed with detailed analysis and synthesis of almost every facet of the office development process. The editor has assembled a package of 32 excellent contributions from experienced writers with backgrounds ranging from property appraisal, architecture, contracting, loan underwriting, and much more than can be listed here. When I first saw this book in the library I had to go out and get my own copy for continued reference purposes throughout my career. 
A10JPWFOKX42PK 0385503954 May 9, 2002 1 2 5.0 a victory for fiction I can't add much more to what all the reviews below have already said - approach the book in a pristine state, don't want to give away any story developments, separate sections all well written in different styles. It's a hell of a book, with a terrific heartache at the end. That said, what impressed me most was how believably McEwan describes Briony's juvenile state of mind - every whim, every extraordinary turn of thought rendered so plausibly. And in the final revelation (although some of the book's surprises can be guessed at, the last is the best, and truly impressive), he reminds us of how juvenile we all, and not only Briony, remain as fiction lovers, however sophisticated we claim to have become: we want our heroes to be handsome, our maidens beautiful and tragic, and we need them to sail away happily together into the sunset. And that is what great fiction, and McEwan, does for us. 
A10JPWFOKX42PK B00004RITR July 3, 2000 13 19 4.0 good, clean recording, but somewhat lacklustre This is an interesting collection of Bach choral works, handsomely packaged, with magnetic names adorning its cover. Unfortunately, for all that it doesn't make much of an impression on the listener. One reason could be the bass, who is distracting as hell - he has a bombastic, Pavarotti-kind of voice more suited to opera, and manages to upset the delicate balance of the chorus every time. There's not much more to gripe about, however. All in all, a good, clean recording, but somehow lacking that special something that makes one fall unconditionally in love with a recording. I bet there are better Magnificats. 
A10K1AI4CC0588 0609608932 December 23, 2004 4 5 3.0 zen cooking Not so much a cookbook as a meditation on the art of slow food. There are plenty of recipes, but the author concentrates more on the way you prepare the food. A former chef at Chez Pannise, he approches cooking with devout respect. This book could have been called "The Zen of Cooking," and focuses on techniques of fine italian cuisine. A good book, it's probably not appropriate for the casual cook. 
A10KCGSDJJAVRO B00023FX1G April 9, 2006 1 1 1.0 Advise: "Get out of Jail Free" pass on this This is horrible. I enjoy oldies and Sun Records-era cuts as much as the next guy, but this is very pedestrian. Yuck! His voice is grading and unfriendly. You may say he is uncompromising but you still have to put good tunes to tape and not much here is interesting. . The 6th song, a surf style inst., "Nephretite" is passable (no vocals, phew!), but even there it is repetitive and not spectacular. . He rocks out some on "309" but the voice is so poor it takes any enjoyment from the song. Yuck! . The non-vocal ditty|"Nabonga" was an Al-right listen, but I'm not racing to Sam Phillips speed dial on this one either. . "Prison Called Life" was a perfectly titled closer, because I couldn't wait for this CD to end. It was a keeper. . Makes the Stray Cats sounds like innovators. . Easily the worst 'rock' record I've sampled since "Drive By Truckers" this year. . Take this low-flying saucer rock & droll and ... el Paso. 
A10KCGSDJJAVRO B000003MV1 August 30, 2005 0 0 3.0 Ah, I've seen the damage and the Needle Gun A buddy of mine in Austin told me this guy is hot right now(Summer 2005) in TX, like the temperature. So I searched out a couple of CDs. This is deffinetly blues, although I'd say this Guy has more in common with Tom Waits than B.B. King. Most of it is interesting music, his lyrics are inciteful and to the point. His guitar work and the occational harp break get notice, but I wanted the melodies to hit me up side the head, the way Muddy Waters hits you, or Jimmy Reed, or Elmore James. That's my kind of blues. If this is indeed white boy blues, and there are many good players out there, I need a hook. That said I enjoyed these songs in particular (in sequence) 4) Needle Gun 6) Sweet Alice Blues 9) This is Hip 14) Hometown Boy 
A10KCGSDJJAVRO B0000026JN April 19, 2005 4 6 5.0 Be My Baby revisited Back in 1963, when American innocence was a way of life, I'm not sure I ever bought into the West Coast Beach bravado that there were really two girls for every boy at Surf City. Sounded more like a brag that 5 guys in white and pink pendletone shirts could never deliver on. But when an am radio tucked under a pillow bellowed out the sweet Ronettes promise that "...for every kiss you give me, I'll give you three.", it was, yes, the promise of a kiss from a girl. And every boy could believe a in kiss. . The difference, besides coming from a lips of a pretty girl, was the sincerity in the voice. . Jump to 1993, a different time, innocence lost. But the sincerity of voice is back, this time in the form of Patti Scialfa. . Runble Doll evokes the girl-group sound of the 60s but in a modern New York City setting. . Patti pens the songs, sung in touching lyric chains, and enlists the musical aid of E-Streeter Roy Bitton, to fill in he back ground with a wash of melodic keyboards swirls. But this is as close to nostalgic and longing she has in common with a Springsteen LP. . The album rocks without rock and rolling too load. Yeah, growing up a Jersey Girl, I'll bet Patti listened to many a Phil Spector produced symphony for the kids and the production owes much to the studio mimicry found within the maracas and percussive wall of sound that accompanies her angelic vocal cadences. . The sound snaps and drifts by like a Summer Night. Muscular and delicate all at once. You want to be there on the street corners and alley ways not missing a moment of the action that lies before you. Her gang, her sound and her dreams of Boys, burgers, beers and board-walks. . Musical hilites include the smart opener, "RUMBLE DOLL" and the Latin-tinged "VALERIE". "LOVE'S GLORY" could easily have been sung by Ronnie Bennett. The second to last song; the elegant, "SPANISH DANCER" is an instant classic, a beautifully played and sung ballad, like life itself to precious to want to ever end..as the drum beat/heart beat plays faint, fainter, faintly...out... 
A10KCGSDJJAVRO B000002IZ6 January 7, 2004 0 0 5.0 Pretty Close to the perfect album . The Great Jim Lauderdale has country music's Midas Touch; his voice is distinctly emotive and the people he plays and hangs out with (Emmylou, Dwight, Buddy Miller) are equally grand...... Jim's debut album "PLANET of LOVE" is also very well worth searching out, but hard to find and pricey, but what a Platet to visit! . . . Jim's Gold. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0609610627 June 12, 2005 11 13 4.0 Excusing Evil I enjoyed the beginning of this book where Weatherford describes a young Mongol who is, in order - a wandering child, a slave, a runaway slave hunted by competing tribes, a carrion eating rats in the dark to survive and, eventually, a world conquerer. What an amazing life. How did Khan get to be a world conquerer? The jacket of this book promises new insights on Khan's origins, philosphy and life. It is a difficult challenge based on the way much of Khan's was deliberately obscured and hidden. For example, when he died, Khan was taken away to be secretly buried. The people who buried him were all killed so they could not reveal his gravesight. Then, the people who killed them were also killed. The Mongols were cautious. Up to the challenge, Weatherford successfully writes about the positive influence of the Mongols. He describes how they were, to a point, democratic; everyone could advance in the army. Because they respected all religions; their rule often entailed more freedom then those who came before them. He also tells how some of their worse excesses were (1) part of the culture of war of the time (2) lies attributed to them by their enemies or (3) abuses which occurred after Genghis Khan was dead. Point 3 is the most important one to make. It is unfair to attack Genghis Khan for horrors which happened years after his death. Still, smoke usually does mean fire. Khan was no school girl. He was a brutal conquerer, which means he was a horrible killer. Weatherford, at some point, sees the trees but misses the forest. While it is interesting to learn about the Mongols' positive influence on history, I think Weatherford tends to minimize, too much, some of their evils. Worse, at times, he excuses it. This detracted from an otherwise excellent book which seems to be both well written and researched. I can easily recommend both buying and reading it, but the attempt to justify some of history's horrors does distract from an otherwise outstanding book. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK B00003Q43A January 1, 2001 3 5 2.0 A Great Show. Independence Day is a throw back to the alien invasion films of the 1950s. Sure the special effects are superb, but couldn't the filmmakers at least attempt to have some story? Instead, they have given us a laughable piece of work. Watch this film in twenty years when the special effects will be old hat, instead of cutting edge, and I bet you will be embarrassed to admit you even saw it. Still, it is not yet twenty years in the future. Today, looking at this film, you will be amazed at some of the effects. For that reason, this film is best watched at a theatre. Since it is to late for that now, you should see it on DVD so can get the most from the special effects. I would warn you that, even with my enjoyment of the special effects, the action in this film does not get going until about fifty percent through the film. Does your DVD have a fast forward? Am I being to hard? Well, let me tell you just two of the things which bothered me about this film. The aliens are eliminating people, city by city. Presumably, millions are dead. Current projections, they will win in four days - killing everyone. But a scientist, played pitfully by Jeff Goldblum, does not want to use atomic weapons because it might pollute and thus eventually destroy the environment. Are people really this dumb? Or how about this, the aliens have some type of super technology that is above anything here on earth. Our weapons cann't effect them at all. Even our atomic weapons, J. Goldblum loses that argument, fail. Yet somehow, he can interface with their computers with an ordinary apple computer. Do I really need to say more? The story, as far as it goes, gets a "1" from me. The special effects, a 6, thus the 2 rating. I have actually watched portions of this DVD more then once, because I enjoy the effects. Expect nothing by way of story, and you might enjoy it. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 6305127638 December 24, 2000 0 1 5.0 "Assimilate This.." Fast paced action, spectular special effects, and a story which brings out the best in all of the cast, this is the best Star Trek movie since "Wraith of Khan." While difficult to compare, I think "First Contact" is actually better because it was more original and had more depth. In "First Contact", the Earth is being invaded again by the Borg. Picard and his crew are excluded from the fight. Star Fleet Command believes that Picard may be too emotional in any such fight. Left on the edge of the nuetral zone, (the space between the Romulans and the Federation) the crew of the Enterprise listens in dispair to the battle reports coming in from Star Fleet Command. Deciding to disregard his orders, Picard warps to the battle. This is where the story gets interesting. We learn that the "Borg" isn't exactly a collective as we have previously believed. Instead the Borg is more like a hive. It has a queen who makes all of the decisions and drones who carry them out. In some ways, this makes the "Borg" worse. When one is assimilated, they don't really become one of the whole, they become a slave to the Queen. This Queen is one nasty women. Her invasion of Earth failing in the present, she travels back in time to beat it in the past. She succeeds. Only the Enterprise, stuck in "time flux", can do something about it. Otherwise all of Earth, forever, will be a loyal part of the Borg Empire. The struggle to counter the damage done in the past pits an outnumbered Borg against the Enterpise Crew and, later,an outnumbered Crew against Borg Drones. In "First Contact", we see Picard enraged as he fights to save the Enterprise and the Earth from an eternity of slavery. With real tension as the form of the final outcome is always in doubt, great, and believable shows of loyality between the crew, visits from many of out favorite Star Trek characters, lovely surprises, and even a visit to the "holo-deck", this movie is Star Trek heaven. Superb. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0440164842 December 18, 2000 2 6 3.0 Lackluster Sequel to Tai-pan This is an interesting sequel, in that, it takes place about 200 years after the first novel, Tai-pan. You don't need to read Taipain, however, to read this book. If you have read Tai-pain, you might enjoy it more. Noble House tells the story of some Americans coming to Hong Kong to open up a trading house. They encounter some English traders whose family has been there since the story in Tai-pan. In Noble House we learn that business today, in Hong Kong, is unlike business in any other place in the world. Romance, violence, drugs, and murder, these are all parts of normal life in Hong Kong. There are interesting characters and a good tension through the book. If you liked Tai-pan or Shogun, you will probably like this book. Why only three stars? Hong Kong is written almost exactly like Tai-pan. I loved Tai-pan because I learned about Hong Kong's past. I loved learning about the times and culture. Here, I didn't have as much to learn, I already read the other book! As such, my rating is based on the story alone. The story here was okay, but it just wasn't that interesting to me. I didn't like the "hero" much. I didn't see much "bad" about the villian. It did move along, and the story did have one or two twists. Overall though, it was too long and not interesting enough to rate more then average in my view. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0394562852 December 4, 2000 17 18 5.0 Epic The Civil War is probably the best book I have ever read and read and read. I originally bought this book over 10 years ago. I have recently re-read it again for the fourth or fifth time and the writing is still fresh, the story still gripping, and the photographs found and used, still riveting. It is simply one of the best if not best American History book produced. Why is it so good? I wish I knew, because then I would be writting books, instead of these reviews. I can tell you what I liked. First, the story telling was beautiful. By "story telling", I could say editing. Anytime a writer writes, fiction or fact, he or she must choice what they put in, and what they do not. To often, especially with history stories, authors try to overwhelm us with details. Here the authors have choosen the best details, and deleted the rest. Second, how the authors write, is superb. They have a great sense of irony. Describing Gettysberg, they describe the worst battle in American History as a battle begun over shoes. Better still, they go on to show it. Now must historians probably wouldn't know or care that this battle may have started over shoes, but these authors know that (1) it is interesting and (2) it also shows that the southern soliders, who needed the shoes, were short on supplies. The authors could have just said that at the time of Gettysberg that the South were short on supplies, but the way they wrote about it here, it was much more interesting. Finally, this book has a great caste, if you will. In this book the authors have five historians who contribute to the story telling. Each historian brings in their perspective and each perspective is different. The combination, however, is stronger then the individual parts. I don't know why the authors chose these historians over others, but it was a good choice. In short, a great book. The only history book I know, which compares in readability, is "The Guns of August." Since that book is better known, many people may skip over this one. Don't. This book should be bought, read, enjoyed, saved, and the re-read again, and re-enjoyed again at future dates. Bravo. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0345336674 November 30, 2000 8 17 2.0 Mediocre Work from A Great Author I love some of Barbara Tuchman's work. In particular, The Gun's of August and the Zimmerman Telegram are "must reading." This book is not. The First Salute was actually the first Tuchman book I had read, and almost the last. To begin with, it is boring. In her other books, she writes an interesting history about the people and their times. She was especially good at comparing different events and showing the common themes that run through time. I especially liked how, in The Guns of August, see details how a French army marching to defend their country from Germany invasion, march past a memorial to Roman troops defending Gaul (Roughly France and Belgium) against another German invasion more then 2000 years past. Events seem to repeat themselves, but the charactors do change. Here Ms. Tuchman's efforts seem designed more to impress us about the knowledge of the author and her mastery of the details of the American Revolution, then to convey an understanding of the events. In particular, this book is actually not a book about the American Revolution. It is more a book about the effect of the American Revolution on other parts of the world, notably Holland. Holland, as a small power, was a close ally with England in the 1580s. After the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the alliance between the English and the Dutch developed into a rivarly and then transformed into open hostility and war. Ms. Tuchman details parts of three wars between these two powers. She then trys to put the American Revolution into that broader context. Instead of being a fight for freedom, in Tuchman's eyes, the American Revolution was part of the continual competition between the Dutch and English empires. This book, of course, does discuss other parts of the American Revolution. But, over and over, Ms. Tuchman goes back to the Dutch. It was their help, supplying guns and supplies, which Ms. Tuchman believes helped sustain the young Americans during the first part of their Revolutionary War. Indeed, the Dutch, on a tiny Island, gave an American Warship, its "First Salute", recognizing them as a equal power in the families of nations. Overall, this was an interesting point of view. But, as I said above, it was not written in an interesting way. Since, I think Ms. Tuchman also, in some ways, overstated her thesis, it took away from parts of this book. As such, I can't recommend this book; but I would steer you towards the other books, referred above, that Ms. Tuchman has written. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0812534832 November 27, 2000 5 8 3.0 Okay Story Demons Don't Dream is probably a fun book, if you are between ages 7-10. It details the adventures of a some young adults who, through a computer game, enter the world of Xanth. Of course there is a computer game which was the inspiration for this book. In the book, (and game), the reader has a "companion", someone from an older Xanth novel, lead them through Xanth. Whoever completes the quest first, will win a prize. Like all Xanth novels, everyone is good - even the Demons. There isn't much tension or surprises. Still the writing is fun and, as I said if you are younger, or have young kids, they may enjoy it more. Those who are a little older, 14 or 15 maximum, probably would be happier, though, if they avoided this book. It is not for you. If you are older and want to read an Xanth novel, try one of the first three. They are still written for a younger audience, but they are very enjoyable for older people too. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0735511462 November 24, 2000 1 2 4.0 Good General Ideas but Not Good for a Practice I am an attorney who defends people accused of driving under the influence in California. This review assumes that you are also an attorney, not necessarily in California. As any attorney will know the laws of one state are not binding, although they may be influencial. Mr. Taylor's book has an excellent overview of the laws of th 50 states. I read this book and learned alot about how I could defend my clients better. Unfortately, DUI laws change more then most. The laws cited here, even when they were applicable to California were old. While you can update them in your library, I would prefer a book where I didn't have to do that as often. As such, I would recommend this book, as one of many, to give you an idea about the general state of the laws and some ideas about human chemistry/biology. But, for a practical guide, I would recommmend his other book "tailored" for California. Still it is a good book, it is well written, and I do recommend it. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0812550757 September 20, 2000 4 6 2.0 Horrible Sequel to a Great Story I loved Ender's Game, I hated this book. It was long, drawn out and predictable. It lacks the humor found in parts of Ender's Game and the tension. The only common element is Ender, who seems to have grown older, more serious, and more depressed. I actually went back and re-read Ender's Game. Could this be the same author? Unfortunately yes. The style is so similiar it has to be written by the same person. But, when Mr. Card wrote this one, he seems to have forgetten the human element, the compasion, the soul, of the first book. I finished Speaker of the Dead constantly hopefully for something, somewhere in this book to justify the read. I never found it. I hope his other series is good. I am going to go to that next, instead of finishing this series. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0345421825 September 9, 2000 1 1 4.0 Great Ideas upholds Okay Story I liked this book. I liked the story and the idea, but I didn't like the "tone" of the writer. It is an interesting puzzle to me. The closest comparision to the writer, Mr. Halperin, I can come up with is Robert Silverberg. Mr. Silverberg wrote some great fantasy books, but they tended to be sad or fatalistic. Even when the hero wins, I never was very happy about it. Mr. Halperin's style is just like that. Since Silverberg has won many awards, I guess Halperin is in good company. I, however, like to read science fiction or fantasy with a lighter tone. Mr. Halperin is "deadly" serious and, in fact, in my book he has several pages of places where you can go, if you want to be frozen for the future. But first, the story. The First Immortal takes us through the life and times of a man who is born in the early 20'th century and by story's end is, in his view, essentially immortal. (I will explain below) Along the way, the point of view in the story changes two or three times. Towards the end, this gets a little confusing, but the story is clear enough. Alot of the story is focused on the conflict between this man, Ben, and his son Gary. This conflict seems artificial to me. It was put into this story to tie the ends together, but it wasn't believable to me. Anyway, this is a distraction. The First Immortal is really not a story of science fiction, but rather an advocacy piece discussing possible science facts. Halperin focuses on Immortality and the disease of aging, but he also talks about computer consiousness, medicine in the future world and different types of bionic technology. In these areas, the book is at its best. One discussion, for example, describes (or debates) what is a person? A person is still a person, if they have a false eye or a fake arm. What about if a person has implanted memories? Or if part of their brain function is mechanic? Is a person still a person if 90% of their brain is organic while 10% is not? Is yes, are they still a person if 50% of their brain is a computer? Where do you draw the line? Since I disagree with how this book answers this question, I disagree with the conclusion of its author. The fun, however, is having that fight about these issues with the author. I liked these discussions, because I discuss similiar things with friends. And, if you like discussions like this, you will like this book. If you don't, don't buy it. For those of you who do buy it, and read this review, email me afterwards. I would be curious to see you responses to some of the issues covered by The First Immortal. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0140280553 March 10, 2002 5 8 4.0 A Journey to a Different Time, A Different World. Galileo lived in a different time, really in a different world. And to understand what Galileo did, and didn't do, Sobel transports us back into this reality so we can appreciate the magnificence of his accomplishments and his failures. Italy was a country in name only. The plague was a natural and common occurrence, not a historical footnote. The Roman Catholic Church still banned books, held inquisitions, and occupied significant political power. And people, lived, and died, on the whim of a disgruntled Doge, a proud Prince, or a remote Emperor. As a practical matter, this meant that hundreds of people, during outbreaks of the plague, died randomly in the streets. Bodies were burnt, if the authorities got to them before family or friends tried to provide a proper Christian burial. If the authorities were too late to stop the first burial, they usually were able to burn the family member who would die of plague later, with no one left to bury them. In the grim alternative that they caught the families burying the dead, those caught could be tortured as an example to others. "Out of necessity" professors would will "their own mortal remains to the university, to save the anatomist the bother of pillaging the hospitals or begging the bodies for criminals condemned to hang." (p173) Even so, dissections and autopsies were illegal, as the human body was sacred and cutting it up would be cutting up a work of God. Legal travel between different regions in Italy could only occur, if one had proper papers and permission to do so. New ideas, especially in books, had to be "screened" by the inquisition to make sure that they did not contradict Church doctrine, even as International and religious rivalry made new ideas from other countries highly suspect. Combined with the high mortality rates of this time, as a practical matter this meant years of waiting before new discoveries could officially be promulgated. Enter Galileo. A devout Catholic and a faithful follower of the Church. Galileo was inspired by another Catholic, Copernicus, who published his own works on his deathbed. Galileo, in the Medieval world of 17th Century Italy, would lay the foundations for the modern world which we live today. Given the strange world and horrible handicaps (political and religious) that he endured, and Galileo's accomplishments become even more dramatic. Sobel explains all of the above, and more. We also learn about Galileo's relationship with his son and his daughters. His daughters, in particular, are often mentioned as we learn in detail about convent life (they were both nuns) of this time and age. We also learn about his financial problems, and successes, his relationships with the Pope and bishops, and somewhat about the history of his father's successes and failures as well. At the same time, Sobel explains the state of science, before and after Galileo, while explaining some of his concepts and discoveries (including his errors). My only criticisms, if any, of this book are the details at this point in the story. Starting off as a social history of the man and his times, the book becomes a little bogged down with the science and its explanations. Given the scope of its content, however, this is a minor criticism - at best. This book saught to explain Galileo and his times, and it suceeded. Well written, with a poetic flair, Galileo's Daughter, should be enjoyable to any historical intellectual. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0671876996 July 14, 2001 3 4 4.0 Good Fun. To my knowledge this is the last work of Roger Zelanzny probably best known for his "Amber" series. To the end he was a great writer and I am sure that anyone who has read his work will regret the fact that no new masterpieces will be coming. I am glad, however, that he finished as he started - working on a fun book which any fantasy readers should enjoy. "Forever After," is a fantasy story which is reportedly about what happens after the villain is defeated. What happens after the hero and heroine live "happily ever after?" Here some of the closest friends and companions of the hero Rango, soon to be King, are sent on four separate quests to hide the magic tools needed to win the war, but which now, by being so close together, disrupt reality and threaten the kingdom itself. Each quest is written was by a different author. They include Michael Stackpole, David Drake, Robert Lynn Aspirin and Jane Lindskold. The prefaces, interlude and postlude are written by Roger Zelazny. Remarkably, the quality of most of the stories is very high. I especially enjoyed reading Robert Aspin, one of the funniest fantasy writers around, (Remember Skeeve?) telling the story of a noble knight and a dragon, from the dragon's perspective. Stackpole's story, about a gloomy assassin heart sick over a woman general who has rejected him, burdened by a fat, but well meaning servant, and searching for his father's killer, his former master, was outstanding. In the end, my discovery of Mr. Stackpole, probably was the best thing about reading this book. He is a superb writer and I look forward to reading his other work in the future. It is fitting that "Forever After's" theme, that life continues even after the story is over, was Zelanzy's last work. Life does go on. But, if it does, does that mean we can't stop and say thank you to someone who entertained so much and so well over the years? Thanks and good bye Mr. Zelazny. I hope the afterlife appreciates you as much as your fans down here do. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0671720767 April 13, 2001 5 5 3.0 Great Start then... Three stories in one, all on a common theme, the war or series of wars between Man and a Catlike Creature, the Kzin. How much you like each particular story will depend on how much you like that particular writer. The first story shows great promise and potential. It is interesting for two reasons, the Kzin and the humans. In particular, we get an interesting insight into the Kzin and an equally interesting insight into humans of the future, in some ways, as alien to us as the Kzin are. The humans, in particular, are pacifists. They wander the reaches of space unarmed and untrained in fighting or combat. They have not even fought a war in almost three hundred years. In some new area of the galaxy they find a Kzin crew, breed to fight and kill, constantly at war throughout most of their history. Can a pacifist people, humans, fight and survive against such natural warriors, trained to perfection? It seems like an interesting question. The assumption is that the people will lose much, at first. If they can learn, however, then the Kzin will be in trouble. The problem is, however, that while the first story shows this great potential, the next two, of three, weren't that interesting. Instead of exploring the issues developed in story 1, they talk about unconnected incident which occur after two or three great wars have occurred. All of the interesting conflicts I was hoping to see, they never materialized. Instead, they have already been resolved by time we get to the second story. Too bad. As such, I would strongly recommend the first story. Story 2 and Story 3, they were average. I think the series shows some potential though and I will look at the other books in it. This one here, as a whole, isn't good enough to recommend. If you can read the first story on its own, however, do so. You should enjoy it. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 630575067X March 11, 2001 3 11 2.0 The Phantom Story Star Wars is back! The movie looks and feels great. The special effects are amazing and should really be seen in a movie theater. In particular, the sound effects were incredible. Laser beams are shot behind us and to our sides, as spaceships fly by in space. Again, it all looks great, but what about a good story? The story found here failed to live up to expectations. Worse, the story failed on its own, even without the Star Wars reputation to uphold. Indeed, if this wasn't part of the Star Wars series, or it really was the first movie made in this series, I doubt there would be a second or third movie made. This film may be enjoyable for kids under 10 [....] But, for everyone else, don't bother. Go see the Matrix or Starship Troopers instead. What? How can you say this about a Star Wars film? Let me explain. First, a small child, seven or eight, saves everyone twice. In one instance there is a battle scene where skilled veterans are being destroyed yet this little kid can fly a space craft there and, eventually, save the day. Doesn't say much for the other pilots does it? Yes, that child is young Darth Vader but, so what. He still is only a boy. Or is he? His mother made some statements suggesting that young Vader may be something more. The mother is also a virgin? Barring a religious expectation, how is that possible? If he was made in a laboratory. Indeed, the Jedi in this book take some of his blood to determine his potential as a Jedi. Boo. Is this the real magic of the force, genetic engineering? From here, it only gets worse. The main new character, Jar-Jar, is designed for five year olds. He doesn't look real, more like a bad plastic toy and he is really annoying. The Queen, is bland, boring, but, of course, "democratically elected." The battle scenes are, for the most part, robot v. robot. So, who really cares who wins or loses? There were some good parts to this story. I liked the fights between the Jedi Knights. They looked nice and were well choreographed. The special effects were good. And the potential for the next film is there. Personally, I have to reluctantly recommend against viewing this film. If you have a five year old, okay, let them watch it. Otherwise, this movie wasn't fun. It just wasn't worth watching. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK B00002NDRY March 3, 2001 5 5 5.0 Onward to Adventure! What would have happened if the Mongols under Genghis Khan faced Alexander the Great, both at their peak strength? Or, what would have happened to the English if they invaded Turkey at the height of the Ottoman Empire? If you play this game, you will learn and learn and learn again. History isn't fixed. The same armies can win or loss, depending on their commander. Age of Empire II is a real time game which continues and improves on the original. Thirteen societies with different strengths and weaknesses compete for dominance of the world. Victory can be achieved in three of the four ways found in the older version - genocide, construction and holding of a "wonder of the world" or capturing all the world's religious artifacts. The key to any victory will be to exploit your enemies' weaknesses while capitalizing on your strengths. The English archers can fire further and faster, the Turks have gunpowder which is devastating at close range. The Vikings have stronger ships and the "Bezerkers" who heal on their own. This is one game where you really should read the instruction book. The pluses to this game, and there are many, include, (1) new army formations (which I rarely use) (2) new buildings including the "castle" where you can make a special unit unique to your society (3) and an adjustment to the "hit points" of the earlier units. Gone are the days when you can send one calvary to a new society and wipe it out. Now they will flee to the town center and shoot you down from relative safety. There are, of course, some negative things. My pet peeve is that as the game progresses you citizens seem to get dumber. They will stand next to your men who are being killed and do nothing, waiting for their turn to be slaughtered. A better program would allow them to fight or flee automatically at the sign of enemies. I also despise the diplomacy (read bribery) options. Pay or die is how this game works. You need to pay off your enemies, or they will destroy you. I think this could be better designed. As it is all the computer armies attack me right away without mercy. I kill them of course. But it would be nice if they didn't focus on me first, every game. Still, all in all, this game is fun! I have played for many hours and, except for Civilization, this has been my most used computer program. Fun, fun to play and, right now, its price has been reduced, so there isn't much to pay. Enjoy it and have fun. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 0345425871 January 21, 2001 105 121 2.0 Overstated Thesis, Dry Book. This books say it can show you "how to understand people and predict their behavior anytime, anyplace." Can you imagine how useful a book like this could, if it were true? Unfortunately, there are no "secret tips" which can "change your life" forever. (This is a quote on the front of the book.) What this book does have are the theories of the writers which include some interesting observations based on their experiences. In science, we call this arguing by analogy. One experience, or three, doesn't make a theory true it just makes it interesting. There are some good tips here. Overall, however, the writing is so stilted and arrogant that whatever you might learn is may not be worth the read. To begin with the writers preach a seven point approach to "reading people." This first thing this approach says is that you need to "spend more time with people" to understand them. It is almost as if this was an instruction manuel for aliens. The writer then give six more points to be discussed in the book. The very next paragraph, however, talks about something different. Sorta of an introduction to why the authors wrote the book. Writing like this, found throughout the book, can make it hard to follow. It is unfortunate because the back cover of this book has all sorts of interesting and promising topics. "What message are you sending with your hairstyle?" or "What does a man's shoes say about the way he will behavior in your meeting?" If the author had a chapter based on each of these questions, the book would have been more interesting. Instead, the author takes everything baby-step by baby-step. It was slow, and a little insulting. Applying the techniques taught in "Reading People" I could have predicted this result just from some of the comments found in its introduction where the author states she "endured the world's scrunity, and often its harsh criticisim, because I helped select the jury that acquitted O.J. Simpson." Hmm. I never know that this person helped select the O.J. jury. Do you think that is why he was acquitted? To be fair, who is on the jury always plays a big role in any trial. But the author never explains who she rejected from the jury or how that made a difference. So in this statement, while she appears to be acting modest, she is actually crowing about one of her achievements. One that might be very interesting, if she detailed how she did it in this book. She does not. There are some interesting tips here. The best one, I think, is that people are usually consistent in their behavior. If they appear to be inconsistant, they may be in crisis, or you may be looking at the wrong clues. With such information, we can answer the questions I talked about above. If a person has very clean, sparking shoes, he is more likely to be a good worker, attentive to details, then one whose shoes are dirty. If a person has a mohawk hair style for example, you may be more likely to hire them at you business, if you want someone who is creative and unconvential. Do you need a book, do you need this book, to know this? I would say, probably not. If you are still interested in this topic, , there is a much better book out there by Mike Caro. It is about playing poker, but he teaches and demonstrates the same principles found here. If you know anything about poker, his book was a much more interesting read. It wasn't great either, but it was a good read. 
A10KKJMBY5L7TK 6305181721 January 4, 2001 1 1 3.0 Best Seen at the Movies The DVD revolution still can not replace the glory of a great science fiction film on the big screen. Watching this movie at home, it certainly seemed like a smaller and less worthier version of this film then the one I saw in the movies. Its not the fault of the DVD, it is the fault of my little t.v. when compared to a gigantic screen. Still watching "Generations" at home had its pluses and overall it was an enjoyable viewing. In Generations, the old and the new combine, to fight an evil that threatens to destroy worlds for its own gain. In particular, in this film a cosmis entity a found traveling through space. If you are in this "ribbon", whatever you desire bcome true, sorta. One person, wanting to return to this fantasy land that he visted once, will do anything to get there. This is too bad for the millions of inhabitants of a planet that will be destoyed for the pleasures of one man. But, as he say, all things die, it is just a matter of timing. Here, the death of a world will help him, and that is all he cares about. 
A10KQMJINSG777 0671732501 April 25, 2003 18 19 4.0 A Halographic Universe This is my favorite Castanenda book, and I have read almost all of them. Please skip my following justification for these books if you are already a fan: Regardless of how one feels about the New Age movement, it is clear that, as Einstein observed, "Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods." Reading Castaneda gave me an appreciation for people who take seriously the complexities of the mind, the universe and their infinite dance. Castaneda, in this book, seems ready to acknowledge that the fact of other ways of perceiving the world seems to mean that there are rational and non-rational ways which intertwine with eachother. Having said that, Castaneda lovers will enjoy the many characters, stories and esoteric teachings that really coalesce in this book unlike in any other. We finally understand who La Catalina really is; we go deeper into the teachings on the Eagle; we get to here more about the interplay between Don Juan and Don Genaro, and we see Carlos opening up a bit too. It was not until I read this book that I realized how hard it was for Carlos to lose his "self-importance," and what a difficult task this is. Enjoy. 
A10L8XPLYAK7SQ 0345465679 July 14, 2005 4 4 5.0 A wonderful example of pure alternate history Too many alternate history stories focus on some sort of alien intervention, unusual manipulations of space/time, or some other improbable or unbelieveable event. Though many of them are very entertaining, they don't reach the level of this work from Flint (I do love 1632 and 1633!). The best "what if" stories involve one small, seemingly insignificant event that occurs differently. Here we have Sam Houston not suffering an injury in battle. Seems harmless enough, but that one event having another outcome might have changed the course of history. Flint's work is obviously well researched and involves accurate historical figures as well as fictional characters based on historical research and could easily be real. This book is a great addition to the genre and brings readers to a period in time often overlooked by history classes and which more Americans should learn about. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to play "what if" with history. 
A10L8XPLYAK7SQ 0312262000 December 8, 2000 4 4 3.0 Great writer...bad editor I had very high hopes for this book. For one, I was very impressed by "The Coldest War". Brady did an excellent job capturing what life must have been like during Korea. But... This book does vividly describes the "Amphibious Landing in Reverse" (As many Marines refer to it) and what the Marines and soldiers went through in their fighting withdrawal. The book breaks down in a simple way...too much repetition. Too many times we read about a letter Verity writes to his daughter with the explanation that "Madame will read it to her". Too many times we read the phrase "trudging on frozen feet" and how many times can he tell us that "The Chinese who were wounded were left to die"? There are so many repetitions in this its pretty clear that the editor either wansn't up to par or didn't care enough to point these out. Did I mention that it was repetitous? Fortunately, I purchased this book in electronic format for my ebook and I won't feel guilty about having it take up space in my bookcase because I hate throwing books away, wouldn't really recommend it to anyone, and can simply delete it with a clear conscience. If you want to read about the Chosin campaign, I strongly suggest you read "Breakout: The Chosin Reservoir Campaign, Korea 1950" by Martin Russ or "Colder Than Hell : A Marine Rifle Company at Chosin Reservoir" by Joseph R. Owen. Both are much better than this and are more factual (being non-fiction and all). Kudos to Brady for trying to tell this story in this fashion, but get a new editor and buy a new thesaurus. 
A10L8XPLYAK7SQ 0804109990 July 21, 2000 2 3 5.0 For fans of the TV show and crime buff everywhere David Simon has written a compelling novel that shows you how homicide detectives deal with the horrors they see every day. If you loved the TV show, this is must-read and tells the true story of the Baltimore PD homicide unit. 
A10LDOM2Y6P0L1 0738808466 November 21, 2002 0 0 3.0 Great Change Of Pace For one to win any contest or to accomplish any task starts with an unshackled mind. This is the central thought author Almas Jamil Sami wants to get across to a new generation of young African Americans with the second edition of his book: "The Unshackled Mind: An Afrocentric Approach To Self Help" (1999, Sohaja Publishing Company, 158 pages). Sami does provide some food for thought in this work by taking the reader through several familiar paths of history with his insightful narration and observation. What truly drew me to the work was the way in which Sami addressed young people who may be a little `stuck' on themselves. So much so, that they `think' that bad behavior can lead to good results. Sami urges young readers to realize that everything does matter in keeping a mind alert, and a life free from unneeded entanglements with the criminal justice system. Sami takes on and cooks more than one `sacred cow' in this short volume. He also hits topics such as the need for hard work and perseverance in order to achieve. Plus he goes behind the scenes for some rare looks at a few of our well-known athletes, providing some commentary and illustrations that will get your attention, and cause the reader to loudly agree--in more than one place. The difference between becoming free in one's thought, and becoming a footnote as to what might have been are brought forward for the reader to examine. No, this work may not be everyone's `cup of tea'. However, who said that `tea' had to be of the same flavor to be truly enjoyed. 
A10LO4GLFBUFEX 0670031771 April 4, 2005 3 3 5.0 vivid Susan Vreeland is fast becoming one of my favorite living authors. Her ability to draw you quickly and seamlessly into a living moment is one of the best I have come across, and I was impressed and relieved to find that the details I found the most poignant in her historical fiction sketches were the ones she gave bibliographic references for at the end of the book. In addition, I found her web sight containing the art pieces referenced in her stories at the beginning of my reading, and it greatly enhanced my overall experience: http://www.svreeland.com/ls-paintings.html In general, I found this book absorbing and vivid, but educated and relatively free from sentimentality. She is able to change voices well from character to character, but not so abruptly and obviously that the book loses fluidity. These chapters, each dedicated to a human life affected by a particular work of art, were saturated with reality and living detail. Really beautifully done; I was sorry to see it end. 
A10LYUXEQ5Q0VF B0001M7OJC May 19, 2004 11 12 5.0 Elysium, My Heaven and The Lovely Bones After I heard this album and read that 'My Heaven' was based on The Lovely Bones by Alice Seibold, I ran right out and bought the book. This novel deserves it's own review, but I can say if you have read this book, you need to listen to this song and vice versa. Maybe this review is based on the blurred experiences I've had reading that book and listening to this music, but I truly believe that music hits you at times when you need it and its messages the most. There comes a time in life when you let go of the authority that youth imposes and create the life you want. You grow up, you get older and at some point the baggage of youth just has to be left in the past. Mary echos this in her music and weaves an 'i can't believe my ears' sonic landscape. From instances of love lost on 'what would you say', migrating and changing friendships on 'Luna's Gone', to finally growing up and realizing that death is not a stopping point on 'Between Here and Gone' and 'My Heaven' respectively, this album is lush and dense. Mary's voice is unbelieveable on this recording. It is rich and strong and absolutely gorgeous. This voice is only matched by the content of this cd: what it means to love, to lose someone you love and miss dearly every day, to grow up and move on, and to finally wake up one day and be comfortable in your own shoes. The pinnacle of this recording is Elysium, which few reviewers have touched in their meanderings on this album. It is nothing short of one of the greatest love songs ever written. It is brutally honest in its approach and free from cliche. It speaks to love as a creature of the moment and how life somehow weaves you toward love at some point and if the circumstances are just right, the winding road of life straightens itself out in that perfect moment. You never had a map, you had no direction, it just happened. If you enjoy this recording, check out Vienna Teng's Warm Strangers, Sarah Harmer's All of Our Names and the Indigo Girls' All That We Let In....three of the most incredible releases of this year 
A10M94ASQEBL56 0553804162 December 30, 2005 0 3 3.0 Always fun to spend time with Odd As others have said, this one was't quite as good as the first, but it is still enjoyable spending time with Odd, his ghosts, and his friends. I think the weakness in this book is all the time in the tunnels. Odd is at his best interacting with ghosts and people. In this book too much time was spent just discribing the scenery. But it is still a good read! 
A10M94ASQEBL56 1582344167 October 9, 2004 12 16 2.0 I believed the hype Hearing the book of the year and Harry Potter for adults tags, I grabbed this book with a lot of expectations. I've seen other glowing reviews here so I assume this is a case of YMMV (your mileage may vary). The old style of writing didn't put me off. But I think this could have been a good (but not great) 200-300 page story. The book set up an interesting premise and contained some interesting sequence. But inbetween is a lot of rambling. The footnotes remind of of Book of Leaves where the first 50 pages or so they come off as an interesting unique devise but by the 400-700 pages I began to find them very tiresome. If you have a two page footnote, maybe that story should be part of the main storyline. As someone else said, don't expect Harry Potter for adults. It is definitely not that. 
A10M94ASQEBL56 B000093FKA July 30, 2003 8 11 4.0 Live is a great band It's been fun watching this band develop. They have ranked in my top three fav bands since I first heard them, when Throwing Copper first came out. Mental Jewelry - collection of good and some very good songs. Intelligent lyrics, but no real theme. Fav songs - Beauty of Gray, Mother Earth Is A Viscious Crowd Throwing Copper - You can see the beginnings of the theme album concept here. Some great songs that play better in the order of the album. The first three songs build to a cresendo then the fourth takes it back down a level to a deep, subtle sound. This happens several times on the album. Fav songs - Seling the Drama, You Alone, Pillars of Davidson, White,discussion Secret Samadhi - There best album from beginning to end. Not their best songs, but here you see the biggest difference in playing the songs alone versus in the order they are on the album. Gas Hed Goes West is a great ending song that ties everything they've done from subtle rock to hard driving rock in one song. It plays differently if you order it first. Fav songs - Gas Hed, Turn My Head The Distance From Here - Some better songs than Samadhi, especially Fav Songs - They Stood Up For Love, The Distance, Sparkle, Dolphin's Cry But no real theme. Just a collection of good songs again. V - They really lose it here. Mental Jewelry sounds polished, whereas this sounds like a first album. Reminds me of Nirvana's Bleech. They show some brillance here and there, but mostly it just sound rude and loud. Especially the horrible "Intro" that I always skip. Fav songs- Transmit Your Love, Overcome And finally Bird of Pray Still a collection of good songs with no theme, but much better songs than V. Some say their best effort since Throwing Copper. I would say since Secret Samadhi. Fav songs - Heaven, The Sanctity of Dreams, Run Away, Life Marches On, Sweet Release, Everyting I See Your Face, Out To Dry, What Are We Fighting For? Heaven and Sweet Release especially stand out. Great album by a great band. Long may they continue to put out good music! 
A10M94ASQEBL56 B000002968 May 22, 2001 1 1 5.0 A pleasant surprise That's what this CD holds for anyone who has not heard October Project and listens to it. I saw them in concert with Sarah McLachlan in Knoxville in 94. Really beautiful songs and really stirring songs. Bury My Lovely, Ariel, Where You Are!!!, Take Me As I Am. Don't miss hearing these! 
A10M94ASQEBL56 0440158532 May 7, 1999 0 0 5.0 Great book! I read this right after Slaughterhouse Five. What amazed me was how I was putty in Vonnegut's hands. I hated Campbell in Slaughterhouse Five, really didn't want to read a book about him, but loved Vonnegut so tried it. He made me totally sypmpathic to Campbell, which I thought impossible. The man is a grand master! 
A10M94ASQEBL56 B000000OMT April 26, 1999 0 0 5.0 wow If Black Sea hooked me, this one secured me on the hook! English Roundabout, Runaway, Melt the Guns, It's Nearly Africa, All of a Sudden...too many top notch songs to name! 
A10M9H30LR4SKE 0345347536 July 22, 2000 0 0 5.0 One of a kind This book is a one of a kind fantasy novel, there are few who can match its simplicity and its brilliance at the same time. In this book Peirs Anthony has created a realm of magic that exists unseen in our own world. The story revolves around a charcter (bink) who is searching for his magic talent so he wont be exiled to mundania. The characters are wonderfully enjoyable and usually have nothing to do with the plot, and pretty much only exists to accompany Bink (the main character) on his quest. This book is an exciting and worthy edition to anyones library. I warn you though that if you do read this you'll most likely be tempted to read the millions of sequels in this series. Of which only the first few are really good. 
A10NCNSS7PN93P B000B5XOYI April 3, 2006 2 2 4.0 A mish-mash of movies in one great box set. After many years of waiting, the Batman franchise from 1989-1997 finally gets the much needed DVD treatment it deserves. Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology consists of the four pre-Begins big screen treatments of the world famous comic book icon. Fully restored and remastered and each film in special 2-disc editions, each packed with hours of cool extra features including trailers, documentaries (Including a fascinating history of Batman and serial documentary that spans the conception, creation, and release of all four movies), music videos, and commentaries all packed together in a cool collector's box. Although Burton and Schumacher's takes on the Dark Knights ultimately resulted in a mixed bag of movies ranging from good, to bad, to ugly, this is none the less a box set that no collector, movie buff, comic book junkie or Batman fan should be without. The four movies contained in this set are Tim Burton's original 1989 summer hit Batman and his sequel Batman Returns followed by Joel Schumacher's follow-ups Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. For the sake of completion, I offer my reviews on each of the movies (in the traditional four star rating system): Batman (1989) *** Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton square off as the deranged Joker who plans to run Gotham City into the ground and the one caped superhero that can stop him. The huge summer blockbuster endures as a museum piece of 1980's pop culture and one of the wildest popcorn romps since the original Star Wars. Danny Elfman's fantastic score and the wonderfully surreal visuals courtesy of Tim Burton and Anton Furst (who won an Oscar for his work on this film) result in a fun-filled action movie that excells in style, but sadly lacks in substance and, at times, coherence. Fortunately the cast and visual decadence help keep the film grounded. Followed by Batman Returns. Batman Returns (1992) *** Keaton returns as the Dark Knight and this time he's up against a deformed and demented sewer-freak (Danny DeVito) and a mousy secretary turned sultry and dangerous Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Darker, nastier and more twisted than its predecessor, Burton outdoes his own previous achievements in visual style and assembles an unforgettable cast (including a show-stealing performance from Christopher Walken) for a solid follow-up. Unfortunately the movie suffers the same problems with substance as the first film did. The plot is at times muddled and confusing, and the characters never quite reach their full potential. However, Batman Returns is enjoyable for much the same reasons as the film before it. Followed by Batman Forever. Batman Forever (1995) ** In the third installment, Batman (played by Val Kilmer) battles Two-Face and The Riddler (Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey), woos Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) and sees powerful promise in Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell). The movie shows potential in a dark corner of Bruce Wayne's memory and his relationship with his love interest Meridian and his sidekick-Robin-to-be Grayson. Unfortunately director Joel Schumacher shines the brighter spotlight on the painfully over-the-top villains (both of whom are miscast), garrishly contrived action scenes, and flashy special effects which are at best overkill, and at worst an eyesore. Followed by Batman & Robin. Batman & Robin (1997) 1/2* The infamous fourth film in the Batman franchise stars George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Uma Thurman each in one of the worst performances of their careers as Gotham's dynamic duo and the villains they face off with: Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. Even more inane is Alicia Silverstone's performance as Batgirl. The film also suffers from Schumacher's over-the-top, often campy direction, and Akiva Goldsman's script is a combination of static cheese and painfully unfunny one-liners. The film is devoid of any humanity of its predecessors, and the "plot" is so incomprehensible, it makes the other movies look like Shakespearean tragedies. The movie does have some camp value, but it gives serious Batman fans every reason to revolt. To those that have already seen the movies and know what to expect, I heartily recommend this set for the bonus features alone. Even the lesser Batman movies are worth investing money in for the special 2-disc treatment. For those that haven't seen the movies yet, this set is a great introduction to growing fans of Batman and between the movies and extra material will provide well over 24 hours of entertainment and information. From the discs themselves to the big box they come in, this is one cool collection that I highly recommend. And of course don't forget Batman Begins. 
A10NCNSS7PN93P B000000WCD April 16, 2001 0 0 5.0 A Big Compliment to New Age I must have seen the commercial dozens of times on TV, and was happy when it became widely available. I was a stranger to the New Age music genre, but something about this collection just pulled me in. Eventually, I bought this CD, and was spellbound. In retrospect, this is quite a mixed bag, but is a nice introduction to New Age. It starts with Enigma's "Return to Innocence" a classic by one of the masters of the genre. It combines synths, the breeze of the lead singer's voice, and an Indian chant to form a good tune and quite an opener. Next comes the radio edit of New Age icon Enya's magnum opus "Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)". Although Enya would go on to do far better stuff than this, this was the first big hit that would help make her the success she is today. A good tune, especially for strangers to Enya's music. Third up is the bizarre, "Sweet Lullaby" by Deep Forest. This one is, more or less, a "grow on you" kind of track. The woodwind interlude, the beat, the melody, and the mystic vocals make the song more engaging and haunting every listen. 4th comes part IV of Oxygene. The old-timer Oxygene is a new age staple and represents Jean Michele Jarre's finest work. Loaded with Synths and moody melodies, it's a classic. Next, the chilling X Files theme is given the techno remix treatment. And what a weird treatment it is. There are techno beats, a counter melody, and one line spoken periodically over the soundtrack. Could probably do without this one. Fortunately it ends quickly enough and clears the way for part one of Mike Oldfield's chilling "Tubular Bells". Fans of The Exorcist will remember this one in a heartbeat. Listening out of context of the film, the song is still haunting and intense, but at the same time quite beautiful and enchanting. For track seven, Enigma's back with another heart-pounding tune, Sadeness. The whispered vocals, sanctuary choir, and intense bridge just further prove that nobody can do New Age and mood pieces quite like Enigma Before the effect of Sadeness can even begin to fade, it's time for "Adiemus", the theme from Songs of Sanctuary and probably the biggest jewel on the collection. Adiemus is unique in its mock language, breathtaking harmonies, and gorgeous melody. After Adiemus, Jan Hammer tomes things down with the smooth "Crockett's Theme". Nothing much to comment on this instrumental, except that it's a lovely piece well worth listening to. The Theme From "The Mission" is not so lucky. It's short and sweet, but not very effective. It pales particularly compared to the preceding tracks. David Byrne's title theme from "The Last Emperor" is a little bit more exciting, filmic, and thematic with a distinctive oriental sound. Nothing great, but well worth the listen. Following is Sacred Spirits' "Yeha-Noha (Wishes of Happiness and Prosperity)". Of all the tracks on Pure Moods, this one is probably the most infectious. I personally could not get it out of my head for weeks after first hearing it. There's a wonderful, spiritual warmth to this track making it one of the best on the album. "Fire Walk With Me" is the familiar theme from the classic show Twin Peaks. It's a nice, nostalgic track, but painfully overlong and repetitive at 5 minutes. Next is another 5 minute track, Geoffery Oryema's memorable masterpiece "Makambo". Oryema's voice is beautiful, and the song is above all else, sweet and serenading. We're now in the home stretch of the collection. The final three tracks begin with "My Wife With Champagne Shoulders" by Mark Isham. There are some beautiful string arrangements to this piece which has an almost classical feel to it. Sadly it too runs a bit overlong. In contrast, the piano piece "The Promise" played and written by Michael Nyman, is short, restless, and desperate while also melodic, touching, and powerful. And finally, the collection wraps up with the upbeat, jazzy "Lily Was Here" by saxophonist Candy Dulfer. While at first glance, out of place in a New Age compilation, this closer steps away from the haunting, deep, rich, fantasy atmosphere created by the album and ends on an upbeat note. So all in all, this is a fantastic collection of some of the best pieces ever made for the genre. There have been sequel collections and other attempts to compile pure tunes such as these, but as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't get much better than this. I personally recommend checking out the works of Enigma, Enya, and also Loreena McKennit (who would later appear on Pure Moods 2). They're probably the elite of all the people here. But for newcomers, strangers to New Age, and people that want a surefire soothing collection of tunes, this is the best way to go. 
A10NI5VMX3HR3W 0441009328 May 5, 2004 4 5 4.0 Excellent storytelling, but with a new slant I am a huge fan of the original Earthsea Trilogy. The world Le Guin has created is so intriguing and it seems that she could tell an endless number of entertaining stories about Earthsea. When I got this book, I was really just hungry for more stories of Ged or more tales of heroes---the greatest wizard ever, the powerful wizard who defeated an enemy no one else could defeat, or the greatest "whatever" in Earthsea. It was those kinds of exciting feats and heroes that I was looking forward to reading more about. However, it seems that Le Guin had a different focus which began with Tehanu and continues in Tales from Earthsea...an extremely feminist approach. I agree with another reviewer who says he can't help feeling that maybe Le Guin didn't like the original trilogy and that she seems to undo everything by making women responsible for Roke, etc. and she downplays the feats of the male heroes told previously. Of course, there can and should be room for the female heroines of Earthsea, but why did they have to take away from the male heroes, the great wizards? Le Guin even has same-sex marriages between women as a part of Earthsea life. Was this necessary? No, but it certainly fits well with her new feminist look at Earthsea. The Tales are still well-told and entertaining because Le Guin is a wonderful writer. However, I guess that I am just nostalgic for the amazing feats and heroic adventures found in the first three books...and I was disappointed to find so little of that kind of story in this collection. The inclusion of women and their importance is also great to read, but this didn't need to come at the expense of the male part of the world of Earthsea. It was an imaginary world to begin with, and never offensive to women---sometimes it's nice to read a book that is not overly politically correct. 
A10NJX8AI9IRU9 B000AMON38 October 4, 2005 13 13 4.0 Super Phone. Durable, step up from i530 and more! I have had several nextel phones over the past couple years. I have used the i530 before, this phone's predecessor, and felt that phone was great EXCEPT there was no way to ID callers without flipping open the phone and also there was no color screen. Presto! These features and more on the i560. Let me list pros and cons: PROS 1. You have to love the durability of this phone. It takes a pounding, and is dust, shock, and vibration resistant. 2. It is MUCH lighter than the i530, i355, and many other Nextel "brick" phones. 3. Aforementioned color screen, Java apps, can use the internet, email, and text messaging if you so desire. 4. External called id screen with flip closed, shows caller, time, etc. 5. Plenteous ring tones and if you don't like what they offer you can download more. 6. Of course, DC/PTT is a biggie...you have to love the walkie talkie. 7. Black rubberized casing has NICE side grips to keep phone from slipping and and is sturdy. Meets military specs. 8. UP to 600 contact entries, what I like is it gives you under one contact home, mobile, a second home #, pager #, etc. CONS 1. This phone is DURABLE, not a looker. If you want glamour, go somewhere else. 2. Buttons are flat in panel and while visible, and bright, are a bit easy to slip while dialing. 3. Phone has no bluetooth unless you get adapter and headset. 4. My battery gave me 145 hours talk time, slighty less than advertised, but it was a first use. 5. Screen could be a little bigger. ALL in all, four out of five stars! 
A10NJX8AI9IRU9 0743445864 January 4, 2005 3 3 5.0 Gets Better And Better! William Kent Krueger is amazing. Each book gets better and better. You can really see the spiritual, cultural, and community issues come to a boiling point in this novel. I will spare you all the details, you can read them in other reviews, but give you the big picture of you will love this book if like any or all of the below: a) you like a great mystery b) appreciate the upper midwest c) like Native American issues/culture d) are a spiritual person. It is a darn good read, can't wait for the next! 
A10NXI59GUCNOL 0520069838 January 3, 2001 9 24 5.0 Most detailed East Germanic-Eastern Europe early history H. Wolfram and T. Dunlap deserve highest marks for the comprehensive most detailed account of Eastern European - East Germanic tribal history. I found many details of my Aesti-East Prussia West-Baltic history. With the Iron Curtain and earlier take-over of East Germanic lands we had many years where none of the history was made public in the English language. The genocide, sancioned by the Allied Control Council abolishion of Prussia in 1947 and the previous and ongoing ethnic cleansing by Stalin communists seems to have been in connection with the silence of the press on matters of any true East Germanic History. Not even the fact that the legitimate Prussian government under Otto Braun was ousted by Military Coup by Hitler July 20, 1932 is being published. Herwig Wolfram went to a lot of searching and trouble to have the ancient history recorded by Jordanis and earlier writers once again made known. The ATTA UNSAR - Vater Unser- Lord's Prayer translated by Gothic bishop Wulfilas is truly a guiding light for following East Germanic tribes from early beginnings to todays Europeans. 
A10OD07V6YBDH7 156854278X August 15, 2003 0 0 5.0 Easy for a family to use! We've had to order multiple copies, so we can use them over breakfast or dinner. I've been wanting to share the hours with my husband for years, but was daunted by the complexity of the other official hours. This one is do-able. I especially like the songs at the end. The words are deeply evocative and I was surprised to discover that that the words do indeed fit to many tunes. 
A10OD07V6YBDH7 0814206115 March 18, 2000 0 0 5.0 one of our favorite books Susan and I were just sitting here checking on the availability of one of our favorite books and we see that this is out of print. Woe, woe! We only own one copy between us and that's been lent to someone who hasn't returned it. This is a book about the love of teaching and its challenges. It delights and nourishes all those who teach or want to teach. 
A10OHNABR03W1V B000056HK2 October 9, 2003 0 0 5.0 VERY handy This changing pad is great. I have two covers, and they both get used all the time! The pad is comfortable for my daughter (she loves being on it for some reason, to the point that I lay it on the floor with her in it!). There's not much to say about a changing pad, but this one is worth getting. 
A10P0BX64HLW7H 0824803248 May 15, 2003 2 2 5.0 Beautifully written If history texts were written more like Shoals of Time, we'd all probably find ourselves more engrossed in the fascinating subjects of our past. This book reads almost like a novel and it drew me in right at the first chapter. Gavan Daws weaves a colorful tale from his well-researched sources cited in his notes. Alas, it does not delve into Hawaiian history before the arrival of Cooke. What a tragedy for us all; Gavan Daws might have held us spellbound even longer. 
A10P0BX64HLW7H 0870409786 December 22, 1999 18 18 5.0 Fabulous is appropriate This is my third acquisition of Tomoko Fuse's books on unit origami. This book is best suited for the intermediate to advanced folder. If you are a beginner, I would direct you instead to Fuse's "easy" books or book-paper-kits. As with all her other books, the procedures are well-illustrated. The results of many of the folds are quite literally "fabulous" particularly if you use some of the finer papers. Samples of each fold are shown in full color pages. Although paper-bound, this book would equally be suited to sit on your coffee-table. 
A10PDEWA7CDG99 B000C1DUOK March 11, 2006 3 3 5.0 So cool. This does support email, you just have to download the (free) program. Other than that, it seems sturdy and is tons of fun. 
A10PDEWA7CDG99 B000060K0H July 23, 2003 2 2 3.0 Half really good; half really bad. When I got this CD, I listened to the first three tracks, and was like, what are these reviewers talking about, this album kicks butt. Then, I was like "Oh." This album may as well have split personalities, because half of it is really good and sounds like the "Breathe" track, and half of it is HORRIBLE. Maybe buy it on sale?? 
A10PWU5VVQZT69 0801438837 January 8, 2003 35 36 5.0 Superb Account of the UN Role in Rwanda As stated above, Barnett was a staffer on the U.S. Mission to the U.N. in 1994 and thus had a first hand view of the workings/failure of the Secretariat, the Security Council, the United Nations and the international community as a whole. Unlike so many other books about Rwanda, Barnett refuses to simply write off the UN or the international community as uncaring or unconcerned about the unfolding genocide in Rwanda. Rather, he shows that those involved were deeply concerned but trapped by their own rules and internal bureaucratic logic, leading eventually to paralysis and inaction. Coming fast on the heels of Somalia and Bosnia, Rwanda was left to implode because everyone involved operated on a logical/ethical plane seemingly far removed from the actual humanitarian crisis on the ground. With the UN overstretched and concerned about its reputation/survival, the members states of the security council unwilling to send troops or supplies into a raging anarchy, and UN rules dictating when peacekeeping and intervention were justified, Rwanda was left to fend for itself. Barnett does a great job of presenting the facts and their corresponding arguments and explaining just how impossible a situation the UN was facing. As he says, none of this justifies UN inaction, but it does help us to understand how and why the world stood by as nearly 1 million people were slaughtered. This book would not serve as a good introduction of the genocide itself, as the focus is really on the United Nations and its handling of the situation. If it is the actual genocide you want to learn about, read another book ("We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families" is a great introduction, as is Fergal Keane's "Season of Blood.") But if you want to understand how and why the international community so gravely failed Rwanda, this is the best book available. 
A10Q9341H2LYX0 B00000JL42 July 2, 2002 13 14 4.0 Perfect Blue is a near perfect DVD. Don't watch the commentaries or other extras before the film as it will give away key plot points - namely the ending. Go to the official dotcom website of the same name for information about the making of the film. The official site says that this was meant to be a live action film but production was interrupted by the Kobi earthquake and it was decided to change it to an anime. There is a mention of an earthquake in the background of a scene on a television set. I'm reviewing the version I saw, the Australian DVD release by Madman Entertainment as the licensee for Manga Entertainment. It is unusually Region Coded 1,2 and 4 (the zones of USA and Canada, Europe and Japan and South America as well). However, it is recorded in PAL format and except for Europe, these countries use NTSC, a different playback format. As a general point, make sure your DVD player has PAL playback before buying any PAL disc even if the disc is your region code or region zero (no region code) otherwise it won't play back properly or at all. There might also be differences between this disc and other region versions so check what extras you get. I don't like watching dubbed live action films but I'm perfectly happy with the English dubbed version on this disc which is well done. The Japanese language track with or without subtitles is also available. It's worth watching the watching the Japanese subtitled version. It gives a different feel to the movie. Some dialogue gets a different emphasis. It also shows up one error in the English dub at 1 hour 1 minute and 32 seconds. Mima should have said "Rika Takakura" not "Mima Kirigoe". This is confirmed by the Japanese language track and accompanying subtitles. This is important as it clears up some confusion that might be created in that scene as a result. Mima Kirigoe is a pop singer who is quitting her group "Cham" to take up acting. We quickly learn that longevity in the music business can be short in Japan. Starting at ground level in the acting business means she has no choice but to do scenes which are worlds apart from her wholesome pop image. Someone starts stalking her and sending threatening letters. One explodes injuring her manager. Even more disturbingly, she finds a website (called "Mima's Room) that has details of her life that only she could know. Things get really scary when she starts using it herself to find out what she's been up to as her emotional state deteriorates. Murders of people involved with her acting career start happening. She might be being haunted and terrorised by her former pop persona that objects to the indecent things she has to act out. Mima may actually be hallucinating the threats and that she's being stalked. She may also be hallucinating the murders. She might actually be committing the murders. In fact, she might even be hallucinating her entire career but committing the murders - or not. Or she may be simply be going mad. Believe me when I say anything is possible in this film. The last 30 minutes continually keep you guessing as the filmmakers keep shifting the ground beneath the viewer's feet. You have to repeatedly question what is real and what it not, a difficult but enjoyable task and you have to especially be on your toes to keep up. What has been going on seems to be conclusively settled, if for no more reason that there is nothing following the end to contradict the final scene. The theme music is quite eerie and totally appropriate for the tone of key scenes in the film as Mima starts her spiral downwards. There is also a frenetic score that perfectly fits the intensity of the murders (or is it 'murders'?). This is an excellent film and a first class thriller. Within the first few minutes, I had even forgotten that I was watching an animated film. This film has a great twist ending, a killer final half hour and a streamlined plot in a compact running time. 3 things a recent and totally unrelated release "Minority Report" didn't have and needed desperately. The DVD extras are very good. A screen says you are being connecting you "Mima's Room" and uses a reverse of the pull away shot from Mima's apartment window in the film by zooming into her apartment, past Mima and then displaying a menu for the extras. Commentary from three of the main English voice actors is very informative and thought provoking about how they interpreted the film and decided to play their roles as a result. It is also interesting to compare Mima's English voice actor to her Japanese equivalent's take on the role. This is the director Satoshi Kon's first animated feature and he does a great job. There is a photo montage using frames from the film and text that details the key events of the film. Also, some studio footage of the Japanese voice actors singing a Cham song and the separate English equivalent (sound only) is an option. There is also some footage of the animators working on the film in the opening menu screen, it would have been nice if a small feature had been added showing the making of the film as well. Surprisingly (and fortunately) this film has not yet been optioned by Hollywood for a remake. This would not be a popular suggestion but IF amongst the current lot of Britney Spears, Mandy Moore et al, one of them did appear in a remake of this film and IF they stuck as closely as possible to this film and IF they did a good job, it would definitely add a dimension to their acting careers. There are obvious parallels as they also are all shifting their focus from their music to acting, which is the theme of this film, especially the downside of that transition and that of fame in general. However, that is a lot of 'if's and probably far too many to give great odds of success. All things considered it's probably good we have fortunately been spared the threat of a remake. A great movie and a great disc. Go see it, buy it if you can't rent it. 
A10Q9341H2LYX0 0312853238 May 22, 2000 1 2 3.0 Worth a look This book is quite good. Dealing with a war against an alien race, mankind is forced to desperate measures in order to win a war against them. Using children that show the necessary potential to fight the war, they are trained at a very early age in simulated combat, the hope being that one of them has what it takes to lead Earth's space fleets against the enemy. It is an interesting book, especially the description of the games in the Battleroom that the children have to fight as part of their training (a form of futuristic laser tag) as a prelude to remotely controlling spaceships. Deception is rife, as not surprisingly at every level, people are not totally honest about what is really going on. The ultimate irony may be, as what seems to be a fight for survival may have more to do with a lack of understanding on both sides that comes far too late and that the war may not have been needed in the first place. Much like real life. Well worth a look, though in my opinion, the parts dealing with the training are the best parts of the book. 
A10QMR1FOD3ZG8 0393020304 August 5, 2005 3 4 5.0 Outstanding Overy is more than a scholar; he is a deep thinker. There is a world of difference. "The Dictators" is a seminal work comparing how the two greatest dictators of all time exercised control over their political, economic, and military systems all while laying out the implications of this control. It is the painstaking comparison, often paragraph-by-paragraph, that gives this work its magisterial quality. But what really makes "The Dictators" work is how it builds on Overy's previous work, "Why the Allies Won," which assumed that the Allied victory was not a forgone conclusion in 1940 and asked, and answered, probing questions about comparative command structures, production economies, and capital sources. Without this base, Overy's latest could have become just another book on Hitler and Stalin. And a boring one at that. With it, however, we get insights unavailable elsewhere. Having studied Marxism, Leninism, and the Soviet Union for forty years, I was deeply impressed. The next step in this line of scholarship is to put it in the context of falling information costs. Wealth is created when increasing amounts of ever cheaper information can be substituted for other resources like land, labor, and capital. "The Dictators" describes how Hitler and Stalin did the opposite, systematically lowering the cost of information or themselves and raising it for everyone else. Following Overy's reasoning in "Why the Allies Won" the question is, absenting world war, was the Dictator system sustainable? If so, for how long? This question is critical to understanding the future of China as it tries to contain falling information costs and keep some semblance of Party leadership. And critical to us in trying to manage our relationship with China. Next book Mr. Overy? Editing: Five Stars. Comparing two systems across so many functions page-by-page and often paragraph-by paragraph can quickly become unwieldy and most would advise strongly against it. Better to keep each leader to his own chapter. But Overy carries this off and his editor wisely let him proceed. Copy Editing: Five Stars 
A10QMR1FOD3ZG8 0471414638 June 18, 2003 0 0 5.0 Information Age Biography The first of the Information Age biographers, Kevin Maney's book on Thomas Watson Sr. sets a template for how Gates, Dell, and other industrialists will be written about when their time comes. Maney reveals a man of insufferable ego who took enormous risks, risks that not even John D. Rockefeller would have contemplated, to reshape the world for a century yet to come. How Watson did this and succeeded are the life skills of today's executives in every industry. A must read. 
A10QUKLNY6C3GC B00003CXDD March 5, 2002 2 3 5.0 One of the greatist George Lucas movies of all! From the creator of Star Wars comes Willow which does have some feeling to Star Wars, but is a lot more fun and appealing. The story starts off with the birth of an infant who will bring upon the downfall of an evil queen. When the queen learns of this prophecy, the baby is abandoned, and discovered by young Willow Ufgood(Warwick Davis), a farmer who is an inspiring sorcereer. With time running out, Willow must soon embark on a quest to protect the child from the queen. With the aid of a great swordsman(Val Kilmer), Willow races against time in this very appealing adventure for all ages. Granted the story does have some feeling of a J.R.R. Tolkien novel, but the charm and appeal it has could be told none other than from George Lucas who is both a story-teller, and a old-fashioned movie buff! The movie also has the greatist James Horner(Titanic) musical score of all. A must for all fantasy or action buffs. 
A10QUKLNY6C3GC B00005JKHP November 14, 2001 0 0 5.0 Robert Wise's "Real" vision for the film! And it really has been fixed to where fans who despised this first entry in the "Star Trek" movies can now relate to it more! Director Robert Wise made a smart move when he brought back most of the deleted scenes into his final format which make it more easy to understand, and keep the plot moving at very good pace. However, with other scenes he did delete, and did not use in the final version, he is able to let us see them on the dual disc DVD set! Along with the new scenes comes new CGI scenes which make the scenes more easier to understand. As the Enterprise goes further into the V'Ger ship, you'll know what I mean! As the new scenes have been added in, it also gives more heart to the chracters of Kirk and Spock, and we understand more of Spock's personal quest for fullfillment with each of the new scenes. Finally, I also love the remastered music and digital score. It made me cry when you heared sound effects like the beaming effect from the original series played in this film. Look for a promotion of the new "Star Trek" series "Enterprise" on this DVD. Thank you Robert Wise and Paramount for the care you put back into it. 
A10QUKLNY6C3GC B000056PMV September 2, 2001 1 2 3.0 Not a great chick flick, but fun just the same! The movie adaption to the original TV series probably could have been a lot better, and been a bit more serious, but it was a fun movie! It borrows a lot from movies like "Mission: Impossible," and "The Matrix" while at the same time being a bit stupid and only borrowing some stuff from the original TV show. It is cool to see Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu be beautiful and kick butt as the three angels! Too bad Bill Murray didn't get to do much in this film with his portrayal of Bosley, and you couldn't see cameos from original angels like Kate Jackson or Jacklyn Smith. Still it was a funny update for the new millenium. 
A10QUKLNY6C3GC B000059XUK June 12, 2001 1 2 4.0 "Superman IV: It Shouldn't Have Ended Here!" Although the film lacked because of the special effects, and the crude editing, I regard it as one of my favorites in the series! It's great because all the other cast members from the first 2 films come back to reprise such brilliant roles! Christopher Reeve's story idea for the film in regards to nuclear weapons was very interesting, and it's the core of everything that Superman stands for! Still I hated the series to have ended like this, and I felt they should made a better film where they all say good-bye to each other! Warner Brothers can try, but they can never replace Christopher Reeve, or any of the other actors! 
A10QUKLNY6C3GC 6304168772 March 13, 2001 2 2 5.0 A very nice down-to-earth film! I thought it was a very lovey film which was filmed beautifully and contained beautiful music! Thomas Guiry did a wonderful job as Matt! A young boy who having lost his mother feels more alone and left out than anything! Even though his stepmother(Helen Slater in one of her best performances) tries to be there for him no matter what, he finds a true friendship and love with a dog named Lassie! With this very new version of Lassie, they treated the legend very fair, and showed us a clip from the old Lassie TV show! You will love this film! 
A10QUKLNY6C3GC 0792837258 December 9, 2000 0 1 4.0 Hellooooo? No one can ever replace this film! It's one of the best and funniest movies of all time that that reflects upon our life when we have a mid-life crisis! Very touching, and heart-filled that mixes in with good comedy from Crystal, Stern, Kirby, and Palance! Scenes that make you choke to death come from no one else but the little guy who stole the show: Norman the calf! trust me, the sequel didn't have much to offer than the original! 
A10QWNWZ5Y1OV7 B000069APY June 8, 2004 67 68 4.0 Very high quality Cambridge makes two comparable table radios, the 730 and the Model 88. (The 740 is a 730 with a CD, and the 88CD is an 88 with a CD). I basically purchased the 88CD because I was starting to feel unhappy with the Cambridge 730 that I had used for while (for which I also wrote a review). I felt that the deliberate distortions designed into the 730's sound were becoming very annoying for my listening, which is mainly classical music. The distortion, in selected frequency ranges, of the sound of natural instruments, had just become too distracting. Now I have used the Model 88 for a few weeks and can make a pretty firm conclusion that it was designed with total audio accuracy as its goal. There are definitely no deliberatr distortions anywhere in it's frequency range. It reproduces treble to higher frequencies than the 730, and bass to lower frequencies as well. The sound is more even and balanced throughout all frequency ranges. When comparing the two using a CD source (I had to use the 730's AUX input, unfortunately, which may have introduced artifacts of its own), the Model 88 shows how simply outstanding it is. The difference was akin to that between an audiophile system vs one for blasting out a movie soundtrack. The 88 was clean and precise and just delicious, and the 730 was really bloated in the lower ranges and muted in the very high ranges. At the end of Mahler's Resurrection Symphony, for instance, when all the horns and timpani and cymbals came in together with the rest of the orchestra, everything was beautifully distinct amidst all the power. On the 730, the sound became more muddied. There was more perceived power because of the artificial boost that the 730 gave to some of the mid-lower frequencies, but it was simply not clean. Having said all that, I must admit that the 730 sounds more "satisfying" when used for listening to FM. The 88 is simply too accurate and harshly exposes any flaws in the FM signal. (The tuner is fantastic, but you simply cannot expect the same sound as you would from the CD source). The 730 makes the whole sound "fuller" and more soothing somehow. Since the two models cost almost the same, the choice between the two comes down to whether you care for sonic accuracy (88), or just a generic "good sound" that can instantly impress, but does not stand up to scrutiny (730). Having spent all these words on the comparison between these two radios, I ought to say a word about their absolute qualities. Firstly, the listening public really does owe Henry Kloss, the legendary designer of the 88, a debt of gratitude for building such a fantastic piece of audio equipment. It truly is startling how much better the 88 sounds than competing brands or models (I shan't mention names; anyway, there aren't that many real competitors in this class). I can even see it being used as the main audio system in a small room in place of a mid- to hi-end component system, it is that good. IMHO, the 730 was an attempt by Cambridge to modify the sound of the 88 to be more satisfying to the pop and hip-hop crowd, plus add a little more pizazz to the dials and displays. That doesn't make the 730 a bad piece of equipment - it still easily outdoes the other brands. 
A10QWNWZ5Y1OV7 091641079X March 11, 2003 14 14 3.0 A little misleading With such a catchy title, one should expect a book filled with practical, detailed, perhaps even step-by-step, instructions (or even suggestions) on how one could achieve the goal of "Learning Faster and Remembering More". Instead, the book is more a digest or summary of the "latest" findings in cognitive/brain-physiology research. Each chapter (usually 5-10 pages) tries to address a specific aspect of mental function. Each chapter usually begins with a short exercise to illustrate the point that is about to be made in the body of the chapter. The body of each chapter then explains the topic at some length in layman's terms and ends with a biblio. Unfortunately, the book is badly in need of depth. Perhaps it is to be expected for a relatively small book with an ambitious breadth of topics. It is an entertaining and quick read, but cannot seriously claim to teach quicker learning or better memory. A more appropriate title might be "Interesting Tidbits about Our Brain". I suppose the main idea one comes away with upon completing the book would be this: your brain thrives on mental exercise, keep challenging it at every stage of your life. 
A10R7XM20Z0323 1884612008 December 2, 1999 6 6 4.0 Extremely thorough and in-depth; not for casual listening These two cassettes are not a Reader's Digest version of biology: this is very intense coverage of the innermost workings of the cell. The material starts with electron valence and moves up from there, and it moves VERY fast. Clearly this is not intended as the first learning source for this material, but it probably would be fantastic review for those who learned it elsewhere and are cramming for a test. This receives only four stars not for content but for the media itself: this is just not the best way to learn this topic. It's hard to visualize (say) chains of hydrocarbons from a verbal description, so pictures in the companion text (ISBN 1884612016) would probably be a welcome addition. Mine is on order. I must say I learned a lot from these tapes, and I will surely listen to them again, but it was quite exhausting. 
A10R925AFE1642 B000056OV3 April 24, 2002 4 4 5.0 Read the directions! The diaper genie works great if you read the instructions and follow them. Installing the refill can be tricky until you've done it a few times. When you put a diaper in, be sure to twist at least 3 full times( I do about 5 half-turns) to get full odor protection. We use small plastic cable-ties which we have around the house for all sorts of things instead of trying to tie a knot at the beginning and end of the "sausage". Be sure to have a refill on hand at all times because you cannot predict when the current one will run out. I have tried many others and think this is the best "pail" out there. Regular pails children can get into...and believe me they WILL. The part where you insert the diaper on the Diaper Champ tends to get soiled and needs to be disinfected often. The Genie is covered in plastic all the way. They now sell new refills for "toddler" diapers for a buck more. The plastic is thicker, but otherwise didn't notice much difference. 
A10R9OIPOUWFWQ B0000013AQ December 15, 1999 5 6 5.0 Hot, fast, superb Balkan Gypsy music This just might be the best recording of modern Rom dance music from the southern Balkans, and that's saying a great deal. Buy it. Ferus Mustafov is a superb sax and clarinet player from Macedonia. He performs modern Rom (Gypsy) wedding music in a style popular across the Balkans today: hot, fast, hard and loud, blending Slavic melodies, Turkish rhythms and the soul of the Roma. For the 14 cuts on this CD, he's backed by a tight 8-piece band: 2 accordions, keyboard, electric guitar, bass, drums, percussion and vocals. Ferus' chops are incredible: fast, intricate, heavily ornamented melodies interspersed with wailing, improvised solos. My favorite cuts: Dada Sali, an irresistible Albanian tune, and Dikman, with a killer vocal by Elizabeta Tapavac. Staro Chunovo Oro is lovely, and it's hard to stay seated during Tikino. Fabulous party music -- crank it up! 
A10RDQBUMCP0SA B00006B1R9 November 7, 2002 1 1 5.0 At long last... Nuclear Valdez should be huge. Their first two albums, 1989's "I Am I" and 1991's "Dream Another Dream", with their beautiful, stirring lyrics and unforgettable melodies, endeared them to a devoted following but never brought them the commercial success of which they're so deserving. So be it. We love them anyway. Flash forward to 2002 and the release of "In A Minute All Could Change". It's a perfect album. The band have lost none of their talent for gorgeous lyrics and can't-get-it-out-of-your-head music. Songs such as "Wonderland", "Still Won't Let You Go", and "Only Yesterday" perfectly showcase singer Fro Sosa's searing, beautifully expressive voice. The music is reflective of a myriad influences, from classic rock 'n roll to Latin rhythms. I've been unable to stop listening to my copy. This is a band which does not disappoint and just keeps growing stronger. Bonus: four versiones en espanol of songs. Gracias Juan, Fro, y Robert, por haber regresado cuando mas los necesitamos. 
A10RGJ0NVVGODV 0767837762 April 11, 2004 4 5 5.0 Elvis is still "Taking Care of Business" This is one amazing little gem of a movie. It came and went without much fanfare, but a lot of movies worth seeing do that. They can't all be blockbusters. Harvey Keitel as "Elvis" only goes to show the genius of Keitel the actor and the man. The exterior of Keitel's character believes he's Elvis up to a point, the interior knows there is something spiritual inhabiting his very being. That spirit could very well be the real spirit of Elvis who has come back to earth to right a few wrongs and continue to change lives. Keitel was never meant to look, talk, act, or sing like Elvis. That's the beauty of it all. Where Keitel becomes Elvis is how he interacts with the people he meets and leaves them uplifted. Bridget Fonda plays a sweet young woman who impersonates Marilyn Monroe for a living, mostly in Vegas, but sometimes traveling around the casino circuit. At Robinsonville, Mississippi's Hollywood Casino (yes, these places are real), she meets Keitel and the emotionally shattered Johnathon Schaech, still mourning the death of his young wife from a year ago. Eventually, all make it to Memphis only a few miles from the Hollywood Casino where the spirit of Elvis also lives in his home and grounds known as Graceland. This is a film authorized by the Presley Estate, so the viewer will get to see the real interior of Graceland from angles that tourists don't get to see. This movie will make most viewers laugh and cry. There's a little something here for everyone. In fact you don't even have to be an Elvis fan to enjoy this film. I recommend it highly. 
A10RGJ0NVVGODV B0000687BN October 23, 2003 6 6 5.0 It doesn't get any better than this! If you look up "cool" in the dictionary, you will find a cast photo from Gerry Anderson's 1969-1970 cult classic TV series "UFO." It's too bad this series lasted only one season. It's an unusual mix of American and British ideas, something that doesn't happen much in British or American TV. At first I thought the series (especially the pilot episode) was like watching Austin Powers played straight, but it soon became evident that there was much more to the series than that. Sure, it has the Sixties look with clothes and decor and cool cars, but the overall storyline contains depth. And as it progresses, the stories become darker and more multi-layered. Set 2, which contains the last 13 episodes, deals with more kidnappings and multilations by the aliens who are out to harvest the organs of earthlings, but all this just proves the point of how important SHADO was (is?) to the protection of planet Earth and to the human race. So buy Set 1 and give yourself some time to get into the characters and it won't take long before you find yourself on a roller coaster ride enjoying some first class sci-fi adventures. I have a feeling that by the time you get to episode 13 in Set 1, you will have to have Set 2 of "UFO" in your collection so you can see the whole ball of wax. Long live Commander Straker (Ed Bishop), sci-fi guru Gerry Anderson and all the other talented people who brought "UFO" to life in the distant future of... 1980. Yep, you heard right, 1980! 
A10RJ73FK600DJ B00006LPC5 September 28, 2005 11 11 5.0 Outstanding Adventure Story This pair of films is almost certainly the finest film version not only of The Three Musketeers, but of any of Dumas' novels. While it may not be truly "great," it is superbly made and one (or rather two) of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen. Under Richard Lester's direction, it is a light-hearted adventure story, but with enough genuine edge for those who demand some dramatic tension. George MacDonald Fraser's screenplay (full of clever, sharp dialogue) sticks much closer to the Dumas original than do other adaptations of The Three Musketeers, most of which transform the story into a standard good guys vs. bad guys plot with little more substance than the average B-Western (e.g., the more recent, one-step-above-awful Sutherland/Sheen/O'Donnell version). The Lester/Fraser version is essentially about four friends trying to survive and be true to each other (and, oh yes, to enjoy life along the way) while getting caught up in the neverending intrigues of the court of Louis XIII of France. The Musketeers are not conventional heroes, and with the partial exception of Milady, their opponents are not conventional villains. Besides superb direction and a great script, these films have a fantastic cast. All of the Musketeers come across as sharply drawn individuals. Michael York is a very suitably nave, impetuous D'Artagnan. Richard Chamberlain makes a perfectly suave and sophisticated Aramis, the future priest, and his foil Porthos is brought to boastful but good-hearted life by Frank Finlay. Best of all is Oliver Reed's melancholy Athos, who gives the film some of the "edge" I spoke of above. Two other cast members give performances as good as anything they have ever done. Charlton Heston is a tremendous Cardinal Richelieu, subtle, intelligent, ever-scheming, but capable of taking a temporary setback with good grace. Raquel Welch may have given the finest performance of her career as D'Artagnan's lady-love, Constance, the queen's lovely but accident-prone dressmaker. Richelieu is ably served by Christopher Lee as a rugged, dangerous Rochefort and by Faye Dunaway as a ruthless Milady. The intelligent actor Jean-Pierre Cassel portrays the near-idiot Louis XIII very well, while Geraldine Chaplin succeeds in winning some of our sympathy for the selfish and spoiled Anne of Austria, his queen. Rounding out this impressive case are Roy Kinnear as Planchet, D'Artagnan's servant, Spike Milligan as Constance's husband, and Simon Ward as the Duke of Buckingham. One of the best things about this pair of films is the quality of the fight scenes. They combine a high level of excitement with a very realistic feel. One noteworthy touch is that each of the Musketeers shows an individual fighting style--e.g., D'Artagnan is a whirlwind of speed, while the older Athos fights more of a battle of attrition, wearing his opponent down. Another plus is that each fight scene has its own clear identity--they never seem repetitive. Like the fight scenes, the overall look of the film seems authentic. I am no expert on 17th century France to truly judge, but the sets and costumes give a great appearance of realism. Each film has a separate score, the first by Michel Legrand (with a bit borrowed from Giuseppe Verdi), the second by Lalo Schifrin. Both are quite effective. The DVD offers the choice of either the full-screen or wide-screen versions. Even on a modest sized 20-inch TV, I preferred the latter. The primary extra is a featurette titled "The Saga of the Musketeers." Appropriately, given that the originally intended one film was split into two features, the featurette is split into two parts, one on each disc. It is very good, with interviews with co-producer Ilya Salkind and several cast members-York, Welch, Finlay, Heston and Lee, as I recall. One nice element is a sort of "in memoriam" segment saluting cast members Oliver Reed, Roy Kinnear and Spike Milligan, all of whom died before the release of the DVD. For some 40 years, from classics like "The Prisoner of Zenda" and "The Sea Hawk" down through John Huston's "The Man Who Would Be King," Hollywood turned out great adventure films that had more to offer than just special effects and slam-bang action set-pieces. Although the Salkind Musketeers films were not Hollywood productions, they are worthy to stand among the very best films in that tradition. 
A10RJ73FK600DJ 0684869128 March 12, 2001 120 149 5.0 Scholarly and Accessible In "The Bible Unearthed," Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman display a rare talent among scholars--the ability to make specialized research accessible to a general audience. In this book the authors reveal how recent archaeological research forces us to reconsider the historical account woven into the Hebrew Bible. Among the conclusions they draw are: 1) The tales of patriarchs such as Abraham are largely legends composed long after the time in which they supposedly took place. This is seen in anachronisms such as the use of camels, not domesticated in the Near East until nearly 1000 years after Abraham's time, in many of the stories. 2) There is good reason to believe that the Exodus never happened. Had migrants to the number of even a small fraction of the 600,000 claimed in the Bible truly sojourned in the Sinai Peninsula for 40 years, archaeological evidence of their passage would be abundant. In fact, there are no traces of any signifant group living in the Sinai at the supposed time of the Exodus. 3) The Israelite "conquest" of Canaan, such as there was, was far from the military invasion of the books of Joshua and Judges. Many of the cities described as being conquered and destroyed did not even exist at the time, while those that did were small, unfortified villages, with no walls to be brought down, by blowing trumpets or otherwise. 4) While there is evidence that a historical David existed, and founded some sort of ruling dynasty known by his name, there is good reason to believe that he did not rule over the powerful united monarchy described in II Samuel. One reason for doubt: Jerusalem, portrayed as the great capital of a prosperous nation, was during the time of David little more than a village. 5) Neither Israel nor Judah emerged as organized kingdoms until significantly after the supposed period of the united monarchy. Israel does not appear as a recognizable kingdom until the time of the Omrides of the 9th century BCE, while Judah does not appear as such until the late 8th century BCE, at the time of kings Ahaz and Hezekiah. Along with their revision of the biblical account of history, Finkelstein and Silberman attempt to explain the origins of the Hebrew Bible, suggesting that the composition of much of the Bible can be tied to the religious agenda of King Josiah of Judah during the late 7th century BCE. While the origins of the Bible will never be known with certainty--there simply isn't enough evidence--Finkelstein and Silberman definitely provide a plausible interpretation. The authors, as I noted above, do a superb job of making their work understandable to non-specialists; since even college history majors often don't study the ancient Near East, they take care to include sufficient background information for the reader to understand the context of their account. Anyone with an interest in the subject will find "The Bible Unearthed" to be fascinating reading. And anyone who thinks the Bible is an accurate history book should definitely read it. 
A10RJ73FK600DJ B000002LQF October 8, 2000 13 14 5.0 Brilliant Live Recording All of the strengths that have won Emmylou Harris so many loyal admirers come together on this album, and are amplified by the energy and intensity of a great live recording. Harris has always had exceptional taste in selecting material to record, and "At the Ryman" is no exception. She draws on great songwriters old (Stephen Foster) and new (Steve Earle, Bruce Springsteen) to present a program that is so strong it's hard to pick out the highlights. Fans of Bill Monroe will be delighted with the three Monroe tunes on the album. Perhaps the peak of the many high points is a beautiful medley of Nanci Griffith's "It's a Hard Life Wherever You Go" and Richard Holler's "Abraham, Martin and John." Harris is in superb voice throughout the concert, and once again has surrounded herself with a brilliant group of musicians, the Nash Ramblers. Led by bassist Roy Huskey, and featuring some brilliant fiddling from Sam Bush on several tracks, the Ramblers are worthy successors to Harris's Hot Band of the 70's and 80's. Lovers of traditional music of any sort--folk, bluegrass, etc.--will want this album, as will anyone interested in an introduction to Harris's artistry. And if any Harris fans don't own this album yet--well, the "click to order" button is just up the page. 
A10RJ73FK600DJ 0738202436 February 26, 2000 56 59 5.0 Suprebly Researched Indictment of Standardized Testing In today's US it is almost impossible to avoid encountering standardized tests--mass-produced, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-bubble, machine-scored exams of all sorts. Standardized tests are used to assess the performance of public schools, in many systems to determine which students will be held back a grade, to decide who will get into college, and into graduate and professional school, and who will get certain jobs. In "Standardized Minds," Peter Sacks delivers a devastating critique of the use of such tests. His indictment includes a wide range of particulars, only some of which can be summarized here. First, standardized tests are not a source of useful information. A widely used reading test given to elementary school students can err by as much as three grade levels in measuring a student's reading level. The SAT, required for admission to most colleges, has no use other than to make predictions, with limited accuracy, of students' freshman year grades. The GRE, required for admission to most Ph.D. programs, actually has a negative correlation with future success as a scholar. Second, standardized tests are very biased. The best known of these biases is that of the SAT against low-income, minority students. Sacks shows that this bias extends to other tests as well. Another bias identified by Sacks is that standardized tests are biased in favor of superficial thinking--the ability to rapidly recall and repeat facts--and against the deeper thinking necessary to solve complex real-world problems. Third, and perhaps most harmfully, standardized tests promote "teaching to the test." A number of states have established what Sacks terms "high-stakes accountability" programs, in which standardized test scores determine whether students are promoted to the next grade or are allowed to graduate, and are used to rank the performance of schools. Sacks documents how such "high-stakes" programs cause teachers to spend enormous amounts of time drilling students in preparation for the tests. Such teaching practices promote rote memorization and superficial thinking at the expense of critical thinking skills and genuine understanding--hardly a desireable educational goal. It is important to note that Sacks is not merely giving his personal opinions. He has studied and mastered a great deal of research. At the same time, his book is far more than a dry academic recital. Unlike the Dinesh D'Souzas of the world, Sacks knows the proper usage of anecdotes--to illustrate a generalzation, not as the basis for it. Of the many illuminating stories he tells, one bears repeating. St. John's University's psych department requires students entering the Ph.D. program to take the GRE, which is useless except to make somewhat accurate predictions of first-year grades. Students seeking a masters degree only, while they take the same first-year courses, are not required to take the GRE. However, if these students wish, on completing a masters degree, to enter the Ph.D. program, they must then take the GRE, even though the only value of the exam is to "predict" their grades in courses they have already taken. Sacks ends the book by noting some optimistic trends, such as the growing number of colleges and universities which no longer require applicants to take the SAT. However, breaking the tyranny of standardized testing will not be easy--the political pressures for the kind of superficial "standards" and "accountability" such tests provide are enormous. But reading Sacks' book, and freeing your own mind from the spell cast by standardized test scores, would be a good start. 
A10RJ73FK600DJ B000001VC4 November 30, 1999 6 6 5.0 A Terrific Bargain This album combines several of Stewart's finest songs, such as "Cody," "Pirates of Stone County Road," and "You Can't Go Back to Kansas" at a bargain price. The performances are excellent--only the Spirit/Survivors medley is somewhat disappointing. For anyone not familiar with John Stewart's work this is a good first purchase. 
A10S2JPBZHTDB5 B000003TAR June 23, 2000 2 3 5.0 In Utero...the message is made With "Bleach," you were living through Kurt Cobain's grungy, unstable Seattle life. With "Nevermind," complex issues were addressed and Nirvana hit it big (or huge). "In Utero" to me is pretty much a backlash at the media. There are some radio friendly songs on here, but even those seem like they would hurt the average pop listener's ears. This can be proven when looking at the static-filled solos (particularly the one in "Serve the Servants), the frenetic pacing of some of the songs, or the fact that the music is so heavy it sometimes drowns Cobain's voice out completely. This is my second favorite Nirvana album. "Nevermind" was so great, so classic, so heartfelt...that nothing the band could do would match it (for me, at least). However, this is great in a different way, and as anyone could tell from listening to the bands that debuted after this album (for instance, Bush), this was the most influencial record of 1993. Standouts include the following: Serve the Servants is a great, instantly catchy album opener. The lyrics are among some of Kurt's best (as he later said they were about his father), and the riff is irrestable. A great solo for grunge fans. Heart Shaped Box is the biggest hit off of the album. A depressing, solemn musical masterpiece coupled with empathetic, regretful lyrics prove to be a winner here. Instantly recognizable from anyone who owned a radio in 1993. Rape Me is also a huge hit from the album. The riff is standard but great, and Cobain's angst filled lyrics against the decieving music business are perfect for the music. Dumb is an acoustic number. It has a melodic cello in the bridge with some good bass lines by Chris Novaselic as Cobain spouts out lines of contradictions and hangovers. One of the more listener friendly tracks. Very Ape has a cool lead throughout the stabbing guitar riff, and is a definate return to the pre-Nevermind era. Pennyroyal Tea is another listener friendly cut, but what's so great about it is the standard slow song melody is met with strange Grunge lyrics from Kurt, so to sort of creep out any bandwagoner fan. Much better than a later version done on "MTV Unplugged." Tourette's is similar to that of "Territorial Pissings" from Nevermind. It's about a minute and twenty seconds of pure noise, and yet it's still somehow...you know, awesome! A great concept for a punk song. The album closes with All Apologies, the second most recognizable track from this CD. Lyrics of mourn and regret are sufficient for the great guitar riff, and Kurt sounds remarkably similar to *gasp* John Lennon in his final lines..."All in all is all we are." Sounds much like Lennon's "Working Class Hero," and the angst is there as well. Grohl's backup vocals help a lot here, sounding similar to that of Staley/Cantrell's harmonies (of the fellow Seattle grunge group Alice In Chains). A great closer. All in all those songs make the album much more than worth your money. The group followed up on Nevermind very carefully...they didn't alienate the audience it brought to them, but it wasn't poppish enough to be considered a sellout album. This, perhaps for the first time, mixed real punk rock/grunge with the mainstream...and it worked. 1. Serve The Servants (A-) 2. Scentless Apprentice (C+) 3. Heart-Shaped Box (A) 4. Rape Me (A-) 5. Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle (C) 6. Dumb (A) 7. Very Ape (B+) 8. Milk It (C) 9. Pennyroyal Tea (B+) 10. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter (C+) 11. Tourette's (B) 12. All Apologies (A) 
A10S5BS2XAVFTR B00019PCHG May 4, 2004 5 6 4.0 Bubbles! *pop* *pop* *pop* The battle with Juromaru and Kageromaru where Koga and Inuyasha team up aside this disk obviously shows they were cleaning the studio that week. How else could you explain getting a pair of episodes that was mainly soap suds. Now I think the series needed this slow down to allow our heroes time to reflect on relationships, but will someone please smack Inuyasha! Inuyasha basically said it himself that all his feelings for Kikyo are revolving around guilt and obligation because Kikyo died for him. He feels it's necessary to give his life for her at the very least. Please, the girl pulled a knife on him while they were embracing and even said he was like Naraku in his feelings toward her. How many more evil things does this dead priestess have to do before he gets a clue that the Kikyo he fell in love with is no longer going by that name? 
A10SDGTVTMPY3U 0553108549 September 28, 2005 14 26 1.0 worthless This woman can not write, her book has no substance, there is basically nothing to review. What is interesting is how much weight she has lost from then to now. Star claims she has not had a gastric bypass......... could have fooled me. My friend tommy met her, he said she is rude and smelly. She is the most annoying person on the view. who did she screw to get on the view? 
A10SDGTVTMPY3U 0967853206 October 30, 2000 1 1 1.0 frustrating book no information save your money This book is very well done you will be totally frustrated by the choices that she makes and the justifications that she has for them. It is obvious half way through the book that the author is just flying through life on the seat of her pants. One of the most interesting things is that she has basically accepted the desease and her condition. She totally blames many of her episodes on her thyroid..........why this author has not gotten this condition straightened out is beyond me. Fixing hyperthyroidism is one of the easier problems to fix. She gives us an insite into her life by telling us about her tubal ligation at age 24 as well as her battles with an abusive spouse which she totally defends and goes back to........... i think that this book would be best for someone who really has a parent who totally does not understand why their kid does not want to get well.........lauren is obviously one of those patients. She advertises the fact that she is a respiratory tech and is in the medical field and can not seem to find anyone that is qualified to treat her hyperthroidism...........obviously she is totally not interested in getting well.......it is obvious that she has not figured out how to get well in fact , there are some passages that make me thing that she is grasping to embrase the disease. I applaud her for being truthful and not wrapping the book together as one happy textbook ending. 
A10SQENA8PRSP0 0316286850 September 26, 2004 7 9 2.0 The makeup in this book is totally unrealistic and unnatural Kevyn aucoin was definately an artist, but I didn't like this book. The makeup he presents is too obvious and fake. The pictures are excellent but he offers little step by step advice. The makeovers are great, in pictures. I would be scared to find someone with that much makeup in the street. This book is certainly missing the real-life/real-makeup element. If he was the master behind so many great looks on celebrities (i.e. Gwyneth Paltrow), why didn't he show us how to achieve their natural but polished style? Maybe he didn't want to give his secrets away!!! 
A10SSXF5ZLT038 B000C1CHVC December 24, 2005 6 7 5.0 Very cool phone I needed a new phone because I absolutely hated the freebee they give when you sign up. I thought about getting the RAZR but since everyone and their dog has one, I wanted something different. This phone has the best reception I have had in a cell phone so far. It also has the ability to play music and games. The onboard memory is about 240MB so it can be limited to how many songs you can play. Keep in mind that ringtones and games will add to the memory usage. The phone comes with some weird headphones - I don't like them at all as the cord is too short on one side. The sound quality is OK but with better headphones quality is much improved. The included software is not very good. I just used the drivers on the CD and dragged and droped my MP3's using the standard explorer interface. The really cool thing about this phone (and others I am sure) is that you cna choose a whole song, any MP3, as the ringtone. The only downside to this phone is that it will not play the Mobile Battlefront game - it is not a choice for this phone. The phone is also smaller than I thought, which is cool. I also like the orange color, but there are grey "skins" included as well. My box came with headphones, charger, software and driver CD, battery (of course) and a grey skin pack. This phone is much more cooler than the RAZR in my opinion. Get one before everyone else does! 
A10SSXF5ZLT038 B0000C0XS0 April 26, 2004 4 6 2.0 Update on a review I cannot remember if I posyed a review on the WGT624 or not, but here it goes. I bought Netgear because of great products and support in the past. I have to say that both have declined greatly. I have the v2 of this router, and its buggy. In wireless mode, the router begins rebooting itself! I have spent some time with this so I will break down this issue here: Wireless mode turned off: no reboots whatsoever, stable. 108Mbps enabled: reboots every few hours G and B mode: reboots every 2 or 3 days in B mode only: reboots every 5 to 6 days. When I contacted Netgear (and contacting a call center in India), it took 20 minutes to explain the problem only to have them parrot back a misinterpretation! Its not their fault, its Netgears fault for contracting with them - sure it saves money but at what cost? Their suggestion was to diable SPI firewall which did nothing. They will RMA the unit. What is strange is if you search Google for "WGT624 reboots" and you will find a host of people with this issue. Problem is Netgear is neither aware of the problem, nor willing to acknowledge the problem. I will send this in for RMA. In the meantime, I decided to buy a new wireless router - the Microsoft MN-500. I read the reviews and it received good press. I must concur that the Microsoft router is problem free, greater range, much cheaper, and simple to setup. I will review the router so look for it. Bottom line, avoid this router. If you are still willing to shell down money for a gamble, I would wait until Netgear finally acknowledges the problem that way it can be fixed! 
A10T43ROKRQALT B0002GU16A March 22, 2005 15 15 5.0 Best use of dual paper option I agree with most of these reviews -- this printer is an awesome value -- after years of suffering through HP's tricolor cartridge scalping, the separate ink tank solution is a godsend. One important tip -- some reviewers will recommend that you place photo paper in the sliding paper tray (horizontal, beneath the printer) and plain paper in the vertical (top) tray. This approach will send the coated paper through a tight print path that can lead to paper jams and cracked coatings. Best to use plain paper in the bottom tray and only load photo paper in the vertical tray as needed. 
A10T8J53N3JPK1 B00005QYZ6 February 28, 2005 12 14 5.0 A Good Thing This is a 'must have' software if you hike, bike and recreate outdoors. The software interface takes a bit of getting use to, but once mastered it provides simple navigation and a lot of information. I do a lot of mountain biking in Northern California and this software lets you 'preview' a trail by mapping it (you draw a line on the trail) and the software then calculates distance travelled and the cumulative vertical ascent. This is very helpful in determining how long a ride will take, and how much physical exertion will be required. It also helps you to track your condition level - as you get in better shape you will be able to do more vertical in less time ... Once you have created a route you can send it (via e-mail) to friends, or post it on the Topo website to share with others. Other neat features are a 3 dimensional viewing package (sold separately fo $20) and the ablity to send waypoints to handheld GPS units. There really aren't any 'cons' to the software. Some things you should be aware of though are that Garmin (maker of many handheld GPS units) promotes its own topographical software. This is a pain because Garmin only allows you to send waypoints form the 'Topo' software and you can't upload the detailed maps into the handheld GPS unit. I own an Extrex Vista and the inability to load maps without buying the Garmin software is an irratant. The only other comment is that some of the maps in the software are dated so they don't always show the latest information in terms of roads and buildings. This you just get used to. Similar to other posts - When hiking or biking in remote areas don't rely on a handheld GPS exclusively, bring a printed map, and have some familiarity with a compass and know generally the area into which you are going - also let other people know where you are going (send an e-mail of your route ...). This is common sense that will save a lot of headache. Overall this software is 'a good thing' and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy spending time outside, and it is particularly good for the mountain biking community. 
A10T9F30Z2UNA6 0451459393 September 11, 2003 7 9 5.0 Fantastic Debut Novel! Way Of The Wolf will suck you in (pun intended *winks*) from the very beginning with it`s wonderful lead character, intriguing plot, and excellent world building. A lot of thought and imagination have gone into the history of the world, and you will be astonished to find out where the Gods and Vampires of our legends actually come from, and how they ended up here. In fact, the world is so vividly described that you can't help but feel like it's a creepy premonition of what's in store for us when the year 2022 arrives! Val has been born into this dangerous, ravaged world long after the cataclysmic events that changed the Earth as we know it now. But even as you experience everything from Val's point of view throughout the story, you will also feel a certain kinship with some of the older characters, the ones who remember how things used to be. I felt oddly nostalgic seeing what familiar things have survived from the old world. It was like being transported forward in time as a ghost at Val's shoulder, longing to reminisce with those old-timers about a way of life that is now dead and gone. Is this book Fantasy, Horror, or Science Fiction? It's difficult to say. Way Of The Wolf is an enticing combination of all three genres. The lines are expertly blurred, and that is part of what I think makes this story so unique and refreshing. And it has a little bit of everything that makes for a well rounded, exciting adventure; action, "magic", aliens, mystery, romance, a dash of humor, and creatures that have stepped right out of your darkest nightmares. Way Of The Wolf is a brilliant debut novel, and even though it has a satisfying ending, there are still many questions left unanswered, and mysteries to unravel. I can't wait to join Val again in the next installment of the series, Choice Of The Cat! This was a fantastic book, and a real page-turner. I highly recommend it! 
A10T9F30Z2UNA6 0441009646 November 4, 2002 1 1 5.0 Wonderful, wonderful book! After roaming the galaxy for 10 years as an outcast, Pricilla Mendoza again finds herself abandoned and betrayed, this time by the captain and crew of the Liaden vessel, Daxflan. Determined to follow and seek revenge, she joins the crew of the Dutiful Passage who's captain, Shan yos'Galen, has his own score to settle with the people who wronged her. This book was utterly wonderful! I started reading and couldn't put it down until I had finished the last page. The story was intriguing and flowed so smoothly, with not a single dull spot in it. I was glued to the pages and completely entranced! Sharon Lee and Steve Miller are wonderfully talented writers who have created such a rich world, and vivid, heartwarming characters. It is a place you will not soon want to leave, and when you are finished with the first book, you will feel compelled to rush out and buy the next one. I have a soft spot for Space Opera, but it is very rare for me to find one that "clicks" just right, combining all the elements I love and weaving them together with skill and emotion. Conflict Of Honors is one of those rare books. I have been a huge fan of S. L. Viehl's "Stardoc" series, but the Liaden Universe is now giving it some very strong competition, and has very quickly become one of the very best Science Fiction books I have ever read. Please don't miss this one. In fact, I would strongly recommend buying the omnibus, "Partners In Necessity", which brings together the first three books in the series: Conflict Of Honors, Agent Of Change, and Carpe Diem. 
A10TV86OGY4FGX B00000BKE1 October 15, 2000 3 4 3.0 We miss you Adrian! This is Maiden's second album without Adrian, and their struggle continues. Although a lot better than "No Prayer for the Dying", the cracks in Iron Maiden's armor are showing. There are some great songs on here like "Be Quick or Be Dead" "Fear of the Dark" and "Afraid to Shoot Strangers" but there is a lot of filler here like "Fear is the Key" and "The Apparation". Although this album was a disaster in the states, and an overall poor effort, this was nothing compared to they next two studio outputs. 
A10U57A32HRQE3 B0008JFCUQ December 21, 2005 1 1 3.0 Good sound The sound is great and the display is awesome. Usability is fine. As for the software... Unless you register with sony and have an online account with them you can only use one computer to put music on the player. So much for work (my business - my computers), my laptop and my home office computer. I am sending it back. If this does not bother you I would give it five stars. 
A10U5D2T50JREX B000065V3Z August 8, 2005 5 5 5.0 Children of Heaven is Indeed a Film For All Families When I think about all the movies made in the U.S. in recent years that have been marketed as "family" films I find very few of them that can even begin to compare to the quality of "Children of Heaven". At first glance the story may seem slight and superficial: a boy from a very poor family loses his sister's only pair of sneakers and endeavours to replace them without having to place an additional financial burden on his hard working father. But even with that simple premise director Majid Majidi manages to bring so much depth and humanity to the story that you will almost want to go to your nearest cineplex and throw rocks at the marquee. Majidi's choice of child actors in this film is a very good one. Their innocent faces register such a range of emotions over the course of the film I began to think that many adult actors should be watching this film and taking notes. Majidi's depiction of life in the poverty stricken areas of modern Tehran is also very well done and later in the film when father and son venture into the wealthy sections of the city the gulf between the haves and the have nots becomes all too apparent. But its in the simplest things that this film shows so much of its heart and reveals to us its larger truths: Ali trying to make amends to his sister by giving her a pen he has won at school, brother and sister having to share a pair of sneakers until Ali can find a way to replace the lost ones, the elation of the father at having found a new lucrative line of work as a gardener for the rich, the kids blowing bubbles as they wash the only pair of sneakers they own and so on. What really impressed me was the fact that Majidi can render these moments with such sublime humanity that he does so without being overly sentimental about it. Few Hollywood directors could do this without having to laden those scenes with tooth decaying sugary sweetness. All in all this is a movie that can be enjoyed by just about anyone who cares for really good film making . And for those folks who are always complaining about the lack of films that depict "family values" you need look no further than "Children of Heaven". This has been my first foray into Middle Easten cinema and I can't wait to view more films by Majidi and his colleagues. 
A10U5D2T50JREX B00003CXXV October 4, 2001 13 15 3.0 A Missed Opportunity I believe the original 1968 version of "The Planet of the Apes" was the first time I realized that a film might actually be something more than an escapist entertainment. In fact, it might have something important and relevant to say to its audience. Indeed, that first film seemed to have something to say on a wide variety of topics: race relations, bigotry, vivisection, free thinking within an oppressive society as well as humanity's place in the universe. It made these points by using ironic twists, gentle humor and downright scathing satire; all wrapped within the context of an exciting sci-fi adventure story. The result was a classic piece of film making. An almost instant icon of 20th century pop culture that eventually spawned four sequels and even a short lived TV series. So, when I heard that 20th Century Fox wanted to do a "re-imagining" of POTA my first thought was "Why?". Hadn't the first film gotten everything right the first time around? Why monkey (no pun intended) with something that was pretty much perfect already? Then I heard that Tim Burton had been assingned to direct and I thought that here was an ideal choice if you were going to re-imagine something as iconic as POTA. After all, he had done a marvelous job of revamping the image of Batman from that of the ridiculously campy to that of the more respectible avenging Dark Knight (only to have Joel Schumaker undermine all of that with "Batman and Robin"). While a re-imaging of POTA wasn't needed, I thought, it still might be interesting to see the results of such an undertaking from the capable hands of a director like Burton. Unfortunately the final product failed to meet my expectations. The biggest dissapointment here is the script, no real plot and flat, one dimensional characters ... The social commentary, so important to the original, is almost completely lacking here. Early on in the story there are some token nods to racism and human vs animal rights but then the writers never develop them. ... The characters, especially the human ones, are hardly worth caring about. Leo, the lost astronaut (Mark Wahlberg), seems to just wander around through the film in a catatonic trance; never even aware of the romantic interest of the human female (Estella Warren) or that of the chimp female Ari (Helena Bonham Carter). The film makes it obvious the two are interested in Leo but, again, fail to develop it into anything. This movie wants to get up and go but is eventually left spinning its wheels aimlessly for two hours. However, its not all bad. There are some things that make this film worth viewing. One, is Burton's visuals. Burton is first and foremost a visual director. In other words, the look of the film seems to take precedence over everything else. Unfortunately that's the case here. The script [is poor] but the film itself looks gorgeous. I particularly loved the shots of Ape City built into the huge and forbidding rocky crag, also the views of the long marching columns of the ape army at night. Also, the forest that surrounds the city is one of those typically beautiful but scary Burtonesque fairy tale type affairs. My favorite aspect to this film is Rick Baker's incredible ape make-up. These are simply incredible designs that obviously had a lot of work put into them. If Baker doesn't win an Oscar for his efforts there is simply no justice in the world. Another good thing going for this film is the quality of the performances which for the most part are quite good. In particular Tim Roth as the violently tempered chimp General Thade and Helena Bonham Carter as the female chimp Ari who sympathizes with the plight of the humans. There is also good comic relief in the form of the Orangutan vender of humans played by Paul Giamatti. And Michael Duncan Clarke is an imposing Colonel Attar. I also have to make mention of Charlton Heston's brief cameo as Thade's dying father. In one of the films few good ironic moments Heston's character introduces the concept of guns into the story. Thade's Daddy has been hiding the fact that humans at one time had such dangerous weapons (apparently apes have never developed firearms) and reveals the secret to his son before he kicks the bucket. Finally, mention must be made of Danny Elfman's wonderful score; a nice blending of Jerry Goldsmith's atonal, primitive sounds that worked so well for the original film with that of a full orchestra. I may or may not get the DVD but I will certainly add the soundtrack to my collection. Ultimately I found this "re-imagining" of POTA a disappointment. There are occaisional moments where this film shows that it has the potential to achieve so much but then turns around and squanders it. When will Hollywood learn that cool visuals and great looking make-up are not enough to make an excellent or even a good movie? 
A10UA219PG4Q74 0446531324 May 3, 2006 4 4 4.0 Get one for your daughter...and one for your son. I must have picked up and put back this book 10 times on 10 visits to the bookstore before I actually purchased it. I mean, I've been doing this working in an office shtick for 20 years and you'd think I'd have learned the types of behaviours that work and the ones that don't. But the better part of me won out. Frankel is an executive coach who has written what I believe is the most valuable book one could give to new professional, female or male. For each mistake, she tells a story of someone who has made the mistake and the price they pay. Then on the next page she gives tips on how to correct or avoid the behaviour. I can see myself in some of these situations, especially early in my career. Chapter 1 contains a self assessment, along with a description of how people learn to change their behaviours. I especially like the discussion about unconscious competence. Chapter 2, How You Play the Game, discusses the types of work styles and approaches that get women into trouble - pinching company pennies, doing the work of others, working too hard, among others. How You Act, Chapter 3, covers the tough problems that I constantly see women project: polling others before making a decision, needing to be liked, sharing too much personal information, decorating your office like a living room, and more. Chapter 4, How You Think, delves into the problems women face when they think too much: viewing men as father figures, refusing perks, and making up negative stories. I found this chapter to be right on the button when comes to how women think. The fifth chapter, How You Brand and Market Yourself keyed in on important aspects of how women diminish their position in order to be "nice". Minimizing your work or position, using only your nickname or first name, waiting to be noticed, working in stereotypical roles or departments were some of the most common mistakes I see women make. Chapter 6, How You Sound, focused on how we women communicate: too much explaining, asking permission (we know what Grace Hopper said about this), apologizing, talking too fast, speaking softly, using touchy-feely language. Two of the mistakes are ones that I see all the time and I have witnessed how they negatively affect a women's chances for promotion: couching statements as questions, and the killer mistake, using long preambles. If you make these two mistakes on a regular basis, you need to get your hands on this book. Chapter 7, How You Look, discusses how you present yourself, makeup mistakes, how you sit, how you dress. Chapter 8, How You Respond, deals with how you respond to awkward and tough situations. One of my favourites here is what to say when you are asked to make coffee, get copies, or take notes. I learned very early in my career to choose to do these tasks poorly. My direct boss knew right away that I was faking it, but his bosses learned to ask some other woman to do it. Frankel here suggest to refuse and I'm not sure how that would go over. My rule is "never be good at something you don't want to do for the rest of your career." The appendix has resources for further development. I read this book thinking "do I do that" much of the way through and I believe that's a great thing to get out of this book. I highly recommend this to all new professionals, as many of the mistakes are made by men as well. 
A10UA219PG4Q74 0345387651 April 29, 2000 1 3 5.0 Engaging.... It's always a treat to read a truly engaging work that leaves me wanting an even longer glimpse at the characters. I didn't know how Irving was going to take me into the lives of these characters without depressing me. Yet he did, and did so in a way that left me feeling calm. This book has been a great change of pace from my normal mass market work. I also have not seen the film and worry that when I do, I will be disappointed more than usual...I can't imagine how a screenplay can begin to delve into the lives of these complex characters without losing the srongest portion of the story. 
A10UA219PG4Q74 0932633013 November 18, 1997 18 18 5.0 It's not really about CONSULTING....It's about life..... This title by Weinberg is *THE* book to have if you fill any type of consulting role. Don't worry if you aren't a full time consultant - you'll find plenty of good rules on giving and receiving advice in this work. I have personally purchased 5 copies of this over the years because my copies seem to "disappear" as soon as I tell anyone about it. Every single person who picks up this book on my recommendation takes the time to let me know how much they liked it - and that says something about Jerry's work. Because Jerry gets his points across by telling stories, this book is the perfect read for a flight, a few minutes between meetings, or when you can't take another seventeen noun, passive voice sentence that most IT texts use. A must buy for anyone who works in teams, gives advice, or ....well, it's for anyone. 
A10UA219PG4Q74 006073132X July 18, 2005 5 7 4.0 Interesting answers for questions you might not have thought to ask... After reading the first chapter here on Amazon, I was hooked on reading this because I'd never thought to ask WHY to these tough questions. This wasn't because I wasn't interested in the answers, but because I didn't think anyone would answer them. It turns out that the authors sometimes answered these questions by ruling out other possible answers (as is the case with their assertion that women's choice to terminate pregnancies has caused a steady decrease in crime). Sometimes the authors said that there was no provable cause, but that there were correlations that may be the answer (as in the case the causes for some children to be more successful that others). While I found this a really orginal and interesting read, I couldn't stop myself from re-reading many sections to see where I missed the great leap from cause to effect. As others have posted here, I think this work would have been much better with more content. I don't mind the mis-mash of topics, but I do mind the rush to judgement that didn't take me along for the ride. I do still recommend this as the topics make great debates with friends. 
A10UA219PG4Q74 140003065X September 20, 2003 2 3 5.0 I find myself using the phrase "It's a Fine Balance" more... A Fine Balance was my first experience reading Mistry's works. From the very beginning I found myself tied to the characters - I wanted to know more about them, even though I felt I had little in common with them. The only other work set in India that I had read was _Life of Pi_. While I enjoyed that read, it didn't do much to expose me to the day-to-day struggles of Balance's characters from different castes. I have to say, though, that what affected me most about this work was how it was drawn to a close. The ending will stick with me for a long time. Now, when I use the phrase "It's a fine balance", I know that our lives are precariously balanced, much like the circus child depicted on the cover. My recommendation is to read this work, then immediately read Mistry's _Family Matters_ to get a different view into Mistry's view of Indian culture. I also recommend that you take the time to look up the various Hindi words and names sprinkled throughout this work. Karen 
A10UA219PG4Q74 B00005AKV3 July 11, 2001 26 30 5.0 Transforms your iPAQ from just an e-organizer to a Pocket PC Until I received my iPAQ Compact Flash Expansion Pack, my iPAQ was just another pretty electronic organizer. I had to carefully choose each and every program and move data on and off the iPAQ just as I needed it. Now I have the CF Expansion Pack and several Viking CF cards, a couple of at least 128 megs. I can install whole films on one of these cards, plus carry around songs, documents, games...well, just about anything. Since CF cards draw minimal energy from the battery, they can be used for hours. Since they don't have any moving parts, they can survive the usually bumps and grinds of my day. Also, since this supports any CF card, I can share these incredible cards with my digital camera. That means I get double duty out of every card. The one drawback for this pack is that it does not have a second battery like the PC Card Expansion pack. However, it's this configuration that allows the CF pack to be half as thick as the PC Card pack. I also use this expansion pack with a CF modem that allows me to dial in to get e-mail, surf, and do remote support where ever there's a phone. Vendors are coming with additional CF devices like wireless network cards and projector interfaces, so there will be more things to easily add to your iPAQ with this pack. 
A10UA219PG4Q74 B00002SAJG April 4, 2001 30 31 3.0 Windows CE 2.0, but not Windows CE 3.0 The description of this product here is not clear and has led to folks purchasing this for the newer Windows CE devices and being disappointed, which I can see would be easy to do. This software works with older Windows CE products, but not newer ones such as Pocket PC or Windows CE 3.0 for Handhelds such as the HP 720. Windows CE products must be compiled (built) separately for each processor used by a device. For instance, software for Pocket PCs must come in three flavours (ARM, MIPS, SH3) today...However, ARM and StrongARM processors did not exist when this product was made, so there is no installation in ARM devices (such as the Compaq iPAQ). When you purchase Windows CE software, you must verify that it includes a version for the processor and operating system of your device. I wish Amazon would list this type of information in their catalog. 
A10UA219PG4Q74 B00004TB3Q February 8, 2001 24 24 2.0 Only for covering a naked iPAQ This case for the iPAQ 36xx Pocket PC will be suitable only for those that carry their iPAQ completely naked -- no CF expansion pack, no PC Card exapansion pack. There have been reports of some iPAQ owners managing to stretch the leather enough to use it with the CF expansion pack, but others have reported that the increased pressure on the iPAQ itself has resulted in problems with the screen. If you do decide to use this with a CF pack, be sure you use something other than your iPAQ to stretch it. Of course, once you've done this, you can't use it to hold a pack-less device. Overall quality of the case is pretty good. This gets a lower rating because it doesn't work with most iPAQ accessories - cradle, expansion packs, etc. 
A10UA219PG4Q74 B00004TF50 November 7, 2000 10 11 5.0 If your losing your data is a bad thing, then you want this Of course losing your data is a bad thing... iPAQs do not have a replaceable battery, so you'll need to keep them constantly charged in order to keep your data. If you travel as I do, then you'll want a spare to save you if you leave home without your AC Adaptor. I have one in my briefcase, one at home and one in my office. 
A10UA219PG4Q74 B00004T0RC August 6, 2000 23 23 4.0 Productivity gains on day one! I'm not usually an early adopter of new gadgets, especially in this category. I'd always wondered about the Palms and whether or not I wanted to deal with a black and white (or green and gray) world of the Palm. I also saw these devices as unneeded if one used a laptop, as I do. I had a tough time getting one, but now I have the iPaq. I can say that this a great companion to a PC -- something my laptop is, but this much more convient. I find the following features the most useful: - Voice recorder: never thought I was a voice recorder type until I started using this one. Making a short note of something takes one second and is less obtrusive than trying to jote it down. - Character recognition: No learning a new graffiti script here. Just a couple of slightv)ery slight) adjustments to how I write a couple of letters and my iPac can read my writing better than my co-workers. And if I carry over these slight adjustments into the real world, my co-workers will benefit, too. - MP3 player: It's been a long time since I worried about carrying my tunes around with me. Having a player with me has made my days a bit more calmer as I wait in line. An unexpected benefit. - Pocket Word, Excel, etc.: Now I can read the attachements to e-mails! I was also able to get a jump start on a spreadsheet I wanted to do while waiting at the airport, but this time there was no looking for a table and a plug in. Those are just a start to the features I'm using. As far as the hardware goes, the iPaq is palms down (pun intended) a winner over its HP and Casio peers. A slim, light weight product with _excellent_ visibility in daylight, the iPaq leaves the others in the dust. A faster processor than the others means there's no waiting. Syncing with my laptop takes just seconds, even with hundreds of items to sync. I find the 'game pad' interface easy to use, intuitive and comfortable. Everything is in the right place. This would have been a 5 star rating except for the fact that there is no built in CF slot -- you must purchas a separate expansion pack to add memory. Palm may have the marketshare today, but I see good things for these PC-compatible companions. I espcially look forward to being able to develop and customize my own applications and utilities with my exsiting skillset, something I wouldn't be able to do with a Palm. 
A10UA4V0Z4691N 0201038129 November 12, 2001 15 16 5.0 Couldn't put it down. This little book, written as a "novel", actually tries to show us that each of us is actually able to be an amature mathematician, and that "pure mathematics" is not that complicated once you get down to the rules. For readers familiar with group theory notations, this is an easy and fun read. Byeond the superlatives given all over to the nice and simple manner in which the number system is built in front of our eyes, I would also like to add I have noticed some ideas Knuth wanted the readers to absorb by reading this book of his: * People too much into civilization need time off to "rest". * After a long while of "resting" people need brain stimulations. * The joy and interest in mathematics comes with the discovery, or at least after trying the best you can. Only then can you appreciate what others did in mathematics. * Teachers in schools would rather tell you about math, and make you takes exams, and will not encourage creativity. This results in that only in graduate school are people allowed (and demanded) to start creating things of their own. * Solving good math puzzles or solving any problem, is satisfying, and makes you horny! * definitions proofs to theorems and ideas should be expressed as simple as possible, and they can always be expressed in a simple way. I could go on with more ideas Knuth wanted to pass to the readers... I read the book in one time, not putting it down for a minute. The flow of ideas and progress in building the number system (up to the pseudo-numbers) is clear and fun. I actually felt as if I was discovering things myself. There is a lot which can be "further probed" after readnig the book, and Knuth appeals to teachers to gives seminars based on this text, and guides them how he would want those seminars to be like. 
A10UEU8TQU6PKI 0060529474 May 6, 2005 6 8 5.0 Read it in a day! This is a great novel. I read two chapters of it in the bookstore and knew I had to get it. I did not regret it. I could relate to the characters, the love scenes were tender, emotion bt. the characters were high, and the ending was just as great as the beginnng. I have read this authors books before so I should have known this book would be good. She has a way with emotions in her writing that is outstanding. She can describe something big like life and love in the simplest words. Read it if you want feel something as you read. 
A10UEU8TQU6PKI 0821776126 June 25, 2004 2 2 5.0 For those who knows what it feels like not to fit in... This is the book for you. But this book is just an all around great book. I couldn't put it down. Read it in two days. I loved Abby. She was a nice woman who could not get over the hurt in the her past. Chase was a dream guy. He was willing to stay with Abby and help her open up to him and the other people in town. I really can't wait to read Kathy Love's next book in this series. This is a first for me because I usually read one or two books from a series, but I want to read all of them. All of the sisters are people I can relate to. More books should be like this. I am so sick of reading books where the heroine and hero are perfect or one of the main characters are. Nobody is perfect and that should always be reflected in books,esp. romance novels. 
A10UEU8TQU6PKI 0446364312 January 6, 2004 1 2 5.0 Opposites Attract I'll keep this simple: Shay was a free-spirit. Ian was a conservative minister. They couldn't stand each other at first, but they fell in love. They went through some ups and downs, but eveything worked out. Love scenes were hot and so were the characters. Wish it was longer, but so worth reading. 
A10UEU8TQU6PKI 1585710768 April 30, 2003 2 3 4.0 Interracial romance worth reading This book was good. The characters were good and so was the story line. I liked how Henrico never gave up on Jacci. He really loved her. I especially loved how he courted her on the ship. This was a quick two day read for me and worth every min. I suggest this book to picky interracial romance readers. 
A10UEU8TQU6PKI 0743430999 March 7, 2003 3 3 5.0 This book touched my heart! I read and brought this book a few years ago and I love it now as much as I did back then. It is a very special book that is both spiritual and romantic. It might not have the ending that everyone wanted, but I feel that if the book had ended any other way, it would not have been as good. I cried at the end of the book and once in a while a pick it up and read it again. 
A10UHOIJ4R52CG 0879517387 September 11, 2003 1 3 4.0 Could of used more step by step pictures The book had many pictures of finished products and a lot to read. I am visual and was thinking maybe it would show step by step pictures and how it is done. I have never used clay or done any sort of pottery, so it didn't really help me. I bought it for my class in college, but I never used it. Instead, I just got my hands dirty and learned by doing. 
A10UHOIJ4R52CG 0064301389 September 10, 2003 2 13 4.0 Its good It is good, but I can't just sit and read continuously. It's just one of those books you just read once in a while I suppose. But, educational. 
A10UIV824IHVO5 630513104X November 6, 2004 3 4 5.0 One of the Greatest Films of All Time!!! In spite of the rather hackneyed expression which I preface this review, Eisenstein has given us not only one of the most powerful films of all time, but also an incredible visual experience. The vastness of Russian steepes is so well caught that one feels one is part of this film. As a result of this film Eisenstein really made a profound imprint on Cinema and gave film emotion. There are so many things that are impossible to capture in a single review..however, the beauty of Edward Tisse camerwork is fantastic. If you are a true fan of classic cinema then this is for you! 
A10UIV824IHVO5 B0000027UK August 31, 2004 8 8 5.0 An incredible Cycle!!! Rather than goading and beating his players sensely Walter was always a gentleman of conductors and was very much old world by the time the 50s came about. Never in a rush, these interpretations balance a view halfway between modern interpretation of Conducting and yet maintains the old world sense of proportion and blend. The Columbia symphony sounds wonderfully European...robust woodwinds out front and a natural unforced balance between winds and brass. Rather recently I heard the Naxos Tintner set and was very dissapointed with the Beethoven installments..and in No. 4 you simply have to listen to Walter. The warmth and roundness of phrasing and the subtle dovetailing of phrases is an instance where Walter can never be matched. I also dislike the idea of doing Romantic interpretations with Chamber music forces...here the Columbia symphony is around 75 players and yet play with a smooth clean sound that is very delicate... I have a great admiration for Szell as well and for different reasons...Szell is very clean and more tense generally which works for Beethoven. However, I really think any genuine collector must have Bruno Walter's complete recordings on the "shelf". They are simply great and appeal to the sensibilities of serving the music without fuss. 
A10UIV824IHVO5 B000001GBY August 25, 2004 1 1 5.0 Very fine performance! I have listened a good deal to this recording and can simply say Karajan has the key to the requiem in D minor. His conducting and control of the flow and majesty of this piece are never in question...in spite of the period instrument approach he has a sound architechtural understanding of this mighty work. In the Dis Irae we are really given bite and push! I think this recording is the sum of the merits Karajan achieves. Maybe not altogether polished and as perfect as some but very musically thought out and grave and sombre as a Requiem Mass should be! Bravo Maestro Karajan!!! 
A10UIV824IHVO5 B00000276D May 26, 2004 1 1 5.0 Superb Here is the right ingredients for Brahms E minor symphony. Add the delicacy of the winds with the incredible warmth of the brass and this is certainly has to be once of the most successful Brahms in the history of interpretation. Movement one has a natural unforced flow which allows the themes to expand nicely. Woodwinds are just wonderful.. The slow music in the second movement is well done. The secondary theme which comes from the lower strings is marvelous. The third movement has a excellent sense of pace without the bombast we hear from other groups... The variations in this recording are the most flawlessly caught...the trombone choir in the last pages is fantastic. Bravo Cleveland and Szell 
A10USHHIZWMKYW B0009XDBAY July 17, 2005 0 0 5.0 From Dreads to silk in one treatment! Saved us from shaving my 3 year olds head! I kid you not , i was hours away from shaving my 3 year old daughters head. Her hair is down to her buns and fine with curl. We were down to brushing it once a week as i was SICK to death of the fights! I was complaining to a girlfriend about the battles, and she begged me to try a sample of this before I did it. In one treatment, we went from starter dread locks, to comeable silk locks. The tangles were managable, and we actually had people stop us and ask if they could touch her hair. I have since passed this tip on to other struggling families. It is great for swimmers as it gets the chlorine out with out destroying it and you MUST by the shampoo. The friend that passed it on to me, was given it on a trip to Hawaii when her long haired girls were in the pool everyday. My review does refer to using both porducts together! I never have spent that kind of money on my own hair products, but the change it has made in my daughters approach to hair care, it is well worth it! The picture is deceving, 33.8 oz is a liter, that will last a LONG time because you only need a nickle size dolup. =) The scent does take some getting used to, but it is still worth it! 
A10USHHIZWMKYW B00004OCKR July 28, 2004 3 4 4.0 Useful product, if you have the storage Great product, works just as advertised. EVen did a great, gentle, job with Berries. Was given to me as gift, when I was in a tiny apartment. I had no cabinet space so it became a, decorative piece above my fridge when not in use. But that is not OXO's fault. I really enjoy this product. 
A10VCNH9CMDERZ 0525931090 July 26, 2005 0 0 4.0 Interesting, opinionated reviews I enjoyed Garfield's comments though I often disagreed with him. I do enjoy some lesser B-films of the fifties and are not nearly so critical in my evaluations than G. Originally my ideas obout Italian westerns were just like G's, but I have relented somewhat. I do not include them among the best westerns, however. It is also right to notice the importance of writers and not always honor actors and directors. That is the major bias of G which I do not mind. This is not for spaghetti lovers, but others surely enjoy it. Garfield can write very fluently. 
A10VCNH9CMDERZ 030680333X April 17, 2000 3 4 4.0 Strong opinions on westerns Though I did not agree with many of the reviews I found them enjoyable. I also share his views on spaghetti westerns. (They are hit on your face). Being an author himself he of course emphasizes the role of a writer. That is good. Garfield does not like B westerns. If you like them, do not read this. Enjoy and disagaree! 
A10VW7VC4X2OI6 B00005MDZY October 14, 2001 5 11 3.0 What's all the fuss about? I almost gave this game 5 stars automatically because it has the words Mario and Kart in it... a shame that it doesn't deserve it. Of course the graphics are great: SNES graphics on a handheld! No slowdown and very colorful. I liked the questionmark-blocks in the snes-version better though :) The sound is ok. Nice voices but the music isn't as good as his older brother. It just seems so... uninspired. And so do the tracks. They are very standard (except for that Indianshyguy-track :) and most important: too easy, even in 150cc. Also the questionmark-blocks keep respawning every few seconds so it's very hard to miss them and you'll blast yourself upto #1 in no time. If you've won the gold cup in each race you can try to get a star/2 star/3 star-rating (to brag about against yer friends) A 1 starrating is do-able but above that it only gets frustrating: you'll have to pick up all the tiny coins (which are sometimes almost invisible because of the GBA-screen) AND avoid the sand, - 4 times in a row - You wanna play the most fun mode in the game, the battlemode with 4 players? Not possible in singleplayer, only available in MULTIPAK-mode. That means that you'll have to find 3 other people with a GBA and Mario Kart. I wish you good luck finding them... You'll be using the L-button (fire) and R-button (jump) a lot. Be prepared for cramps... So all in all this game, although it sounds great, just doesn't delivers the charming fun of the SNES-version. I you really wanna play this, have you considered buying the original? 
A10VW7VC4X2OI6 B00004UE0O April 2, 2001 15 25 4.0 Prototype of the future 4 out of 5 stars for BLACK & WHITE?! Yep. Although everybody seems to go totally nuts about this extreamly hyped game, I still found it a slight dissapointment. This is mainly because it's a GAME. You can't have total freedom cuz' it's programmed. The AI isn't perfect cuz' computers aren't. Lots of people (influenced by the press) didn't want to see this as a game anymore but as another, perfect world. I myself went with the hype and that's why I'm a little dissapointed. I've got absolutely nothing to complain about the graphics. They're in one word stunning. Highly detailed and the level of zooming is almost scary! Sound is also right all along. The devil with a 'New York cabdriveraccent' and the saint with the very brittish accent... the music also changes when your more evil or less evil. And then the game itself... it's just not all that fun. You just have to convert vilages over and over again. The so-called great submissions just really have 2 options (and not 20 like those gamemags say): helping the villager (9 out of 10 times by finding something) or killing him. You'll only really use the titan for converting and helping villages. Also it's very (too) easy to learn 'em things and he doesn't really do much unexpected things. The AI is to blame for that. Not that it's bad, not at all, but we human beings aren't capable, yet, of programming humanlike AI. And that's what bothers me most. I want the game to be more. But it simply isn't. 
A10W5NFZ9PLX4K B000002IML January 11, 2003 1 1 4.0 The fusion of Dokken and Ratt I only heard of the band, Winger, two years ago on a local radio station after listening to their song, "Seventeen." Being impressed by that catchy, upbeat and Motley Crue/Ratt-style song, I very recently purchased Winger's self-titled debut (which I knew included "Seventeen"), placing blind faith that the CD would not disappoint. Winger's style of hard rock is similar to that of many other '80s "hair metal" bands (esp., Def Leppard, Dokken, and Ratt) -which most people today seem to find cheesy and outdated. The name, "Winger," also sounds very cheesy. But don't let the name fool you. Winger is as good a hard rock album as I've ever come across. There's good reason that "Seventeen" is one of the two Winger songs I've ever heard on the radio: It's probably the catchiest of all the songs on this album and also my favorite, but most the others are very Ratt-like catchy and upbeat, also; esp., "Madalaine" which is another favorite of mine. "Hungry" will remind you of some of Europe's pop-metal and "Headed For a Heartbreak" is startingly reminiscent of some of Chicago's '80s Pop/Rock. "Purple Haze" is a Jimi Hendrix remake and I, personally, like Winger's version much better. It's very similar to the original but Winger's version is much harder and faster and simply rocks. The remaining songs have a sound and style similar to either Ratt or Dokken. The instrumentation of Winger, while not spectacular, is very good, nonetheless. Reb Beach's blazingly fast guitar leads and solos on certain songs are comparable to Eddie Van Halen's best. The only minor weaknesses that Winger has is that -for the better and worse- several songs contain Dokken-like refinement but also Dokken-like lack of personality. (For numerous reasons, I consider Dokken to be the "Honda Accord" of '80s hard rock bands.) Hence, several songs -though not necessarily "fillers"- don't have much flair or distinction, either. All in all, however, Winger is a surprisingly solid and catchy, upbeat debut from a very unpopular group that should please any hard rock enthusiast. 
A10W5NFZ9PLX4K B000001909 September 6, 2002 0 0 4.0 Best Bass 305 album, by far. Bass The Future is not only Bass 305's best album but is also probably the second best bass album, by any bass artist, that I've ever listened to. ... the album leaves a lot to be desired, as half of the songs are pretty cool techno-like bass songs (instead of just electronic noises jumbled together having little or no melody -which is what most bass "music" is) and half are either "cheesy" (such as Pure Tone and Bass Epilogue where a scientist of some sort talks about the science of bass and it's effects on the ear) or just "fillers" that lack any substance. My two favorite tracks by far are Automated Digital Bass and BASS mission 305. They're probably my two favorite tracks from any of 305's albums. If you're a bass stickler, this album is a must-have: It thumps big-time, has very clean and un-distorted bass tones and has some truly cool techno-bass songs (which are ACTUALLY songs), rife with all types of alien-like outer space noises and other digital sounds. Great job Mark and Dave Watson. 
A10W5NFZ9PLX4K B00000F1IZ January 17, 2002 1 2 1.0 So pathetic and stupid, it was HILARIOUS! The Karate Kid trilogy despicably ends with one of the most pathetic movies ever produced, "Karate Kid 3," which was SO stupid, in fact, that it was funny. Years after Daniel-sahn has returned home from Japan, he has yet a NEW girlfriend, and resides with Miyagi somewhere in the U.S.A. Daniel-sahn is overweight and looking at him walk and talk, one would never guess that he even ever SAW a karate move in his entire life, much less PRACTICED one. He looks like a chubby nerd who probably couldn't defend himself against a scrappy chihuahua puppy, let alone an adept karateka. In this flic, Daniel-sahn is coerced in numerous ways to begin training for a karate tournament that neither he nor Miyagi have any desire in entering. Miyagi, in fact, initially refuses to train him and tells Daniel-sahn that he's on his own. In comes Daniel's deus ex machina: One of the "bad guys" deceives Daniel into believing that he's a good guy that wants to train Daniel-sahn. And he trains him by having Daniel hitting wooden boards so hard that they bludgeon his fists! This aggressive training leads Daniel-sahn to break someone's nose, and finally the idiot gets a clue and realizes that he's been set up all along. Finally, Miyagi comes into the picture and gets Daniel back into true form in time for the tournament where Daniel faces an opponent who is clearly much more confident and aggresive than Macchio. The tactic of Macchio's opponent -in typical, predictable fashion- is to injure Daniel-sahn as severely as possible, scoring illegal hits, then score a legal hit to win. In typical fashion, Daniel-sahn pulls himself together and wins the last point and the movie ends. This is definitely a movie that should be submitted to Mystery Science Theater for review. Don't get me wrong; there's plenty of comedy, but the only problem is that the producers of the movie didn't INTEND this flic to be a comedy. Purchase this movie only if you enjoy comedies, but don't expect any of the drama and interesting plot found in the previous two Karate Kids. 
A10W5NFZ9PLX4K B00000J2KF January 16, 2002 0 5 1.0 Stupid and cheesy Like the first Ghostbusters movie, I only recently saw Ghostbusters II for the first time only two weeks ago, and all I can say is that it was a monumental waste of my time, and all I had was time to waste in the first place. Part two includes the same cast of brainless actors and a much worse plot and packs a much less exciting movie. The special effects, if anything, seem less spectacular than it's prequel, which came out 5 years earlier, and the plot is unexciting, confusing and drags on. The culmination of this stupidity reaches its climax when citizens of New York City sing together to diminish the malevolent energy responsible for the ominous protoplasmic formations which are enveloping the city! Judas Priest, how stupid is THAT?! It also seems that the only action in the movie is at the very end and it's cheesy, at best. Is it coincidence that this movie came out the same year Back To The Future II (by FAR, the worst of the Back To The Future movies) did and that they BOTH merit submission for review to Mystery Science Theater? I guess '89 just wasn't a great year for Hollywood. 
A10W5NFZ9PLX4K B000002LQJ January 16, 2002 2 2 5.0 One of their best Chorus is Erasure in their prime from a chronological standpoint and representative of their apex from a music standpoint. Chorus is unique in that it marks a return of Vince Clarke from the Oberheim Xpander synthesizer (used in Erasure's earlier material which has a more acoustic quality) to analog synths, which tones have a more computerized quality and use all types of metallic bleeps and blips. Clarke employs analog synths in Chorus to create a more sincere and serious -somewhat darker- album than '80s Erasure material, virtually all of which is campy and happy-go-lucky. Though the sound and direction is different, the end result is the same: Chorus is has all the poignancy and diversity from song to song as vintage '80s albums such as "The Circus" and "The Innocents" had. Some songs are upbeat and dancy, and others are slow but in the end it still sounds like vintage Erasure and remains one of Andy Bell's and Vince Clarke's best efforts, ever. 
A10W5NFZ9PLX4K 155686339X January 14, 2002 13 14 5.0 Fascinating and Authentic Life Among The Apaches is one of the most interesting and fascinating historical nonfiction works that I have ever come across. It's a first-hand account of John C. Cremony's personal adventures with Apache indians in the latter part of the 19th century, in particular the Chiricahua Apaches. I've never come across a better or more explanatory or descriptive account of Apache peoples, culture, or way of life in the 1800's than in Life Among The Apaches. This book was given to me as a present some years ago, and it has proven to be one of the most authentic Native American historical pieces of literature that has ever been abridged. 
A10WCSGF78M2KE B00005TQ46 April 25, 2002 31 31 5.0 It's Dark and this DVD is Hot! Every artist who puts out a DVD, should follow this project's lead. This has everything you could ever ask for. Virtually ALL of the artist videos. Classic live performances. A "real-life" look into the artist life. A short movie that depicts the ultimate presentation of how DMX's soul is at battle between the forces of good and evil to control one man's life. What else could you ask for? DMX - Angel is the perfect package. From the short 24-minute movie, Angel, where DMX tells us from a narrator point of view on his life and how he struggles to stay righteous, to his classic performance at the famous Apollo Theatre. Wouldn't it be great if they put out a DVD exactly like this on Eminem, Jay-Z, even Snoop Dogg? Unquestionably a definate satisfaction for ANY DMX fan. If you're a fan of his music....What are you waiting for? Get up and go cop this! 
A10WHVY0CM97KI 630507190X June 1, 2001 3 4 5.0 Stunning Revelation for Post-Boomers I first saw the (very grainy and undoubtedly bootlegged) Zapruder film at a teach-in during my college days. Finally, about thirty years later, it's possible to view it about as clearly as we're ever likely to see. This is an essential historic document. It certainly won't answer all the questions that still float around about JFK's assassination, but anyone with even a mild interest in history will be fascinated by (a) how the film came into being, (b) how it was preserved and enhanced (probably thereby providing new grist for conspiracy theorists' mills?), and (c) the haunting images. I found myself, while watching the various versions (close, closer still, etc.), quietly hoping that at least one of them would turn out differently than all of them had, ever did, and always will. Absolutely essential for students of the JFK assassination. 
A10WOHX7AOZ8MU B000A2H880 February 4, 2006 2 3 5.0 The New Pornographers- Twin Cinema: Best of 2005 These album, really doesn't need a super-eloquent review to entice listeners to sample this album. Twin Cinema is such a catchy pop-piece, I think it would be hard to keep people away from this album. "Twin Cinema", "bones of an Idol", "These are the fables", "Use It", and my favorite "Bleeding Heart Show" are some of the best tracks...But who cares? This album is good enough to purchase and listen to in its entirety, catchy enough to keep your interest, but poignant at times and mellow during Neko Case's vocals as well, which helps maintain the albums longevity. In other words, Twin Cinema never gets old. Check the New Pornographers' back catalogue, they aren't new at writing exceptional pop. Yet, none of their prior albums has been as cumulatively GREAT as this one. Heck, even my parents like it. A Best Album of 2005 
A10WOHX7AOZ8MU B00000DG1R August 2, 2005 2 6 4.0 Duran Duran is cool So this is from where The Killers, The Bravery, Action Action, and all the new-wave electronica/synth pop of today draw their influences. Great fun. :) In my opinion, this band isnt more of a "hidden treasures" band, where their little-known songs are greatest. I have heard most of the work, and since this is a pop band, the catchy ones work best. Thus, the catchy hits they produce are their best, so this CD is the best pick. 
A10WOHX7AOZ8MU B000255LKW July 3, 2005 79 125 1.0 Ugh To show example of Hawthorne Heights's main audience, I'll post a 5-star review given on this site for this cd: "This is one of the best cd's i have in my collection and i have a ton all the way from green day to good charlotte and Hawthorne is awesome I Love the song NIKI FM and anyone who insultes Hawthorne doesnt know anything about good music so um.. Ya!! Hawthorne is AWSOME everyone should own this CD!" Um Ya! So basically for the "hard-core" punk sk8er girl with a collection all the way from GC to Greenday (since pop-punk to even worse pop-punk is such a broad variety of musical taste) this is the perfect CD to proudly tote around. The screaming on this sounds like the screamer might barf any second after his lines are over. The cliche emo lyrics "so cut my wrists and black my eyes" are hard to even take seriously, they are that overdone. Their self-mutilation may have been inflicted after hearing their own voices on CD perhaps? (Yes I am being brutal), but this is an embarrassing attempt of a harcore/screamo/emo/punk/poseur goth(or at least i want to be)CD. 
A10WOHX7AOZ8MU B0001M7P78 May 14, 2005 3 5 5.0 Good News for MTV, but... Ok, Modest Mouse has changed...I dont give a rip///// But, I do care about this new, idk "MTVness" that has Float on (an otherwise ok song but by no means great) on constant repeat. I hear the beginning beats and then drums of Float on and cringe. Hey, this is my FAVORITE band, i shouldnt be cringing! darn radio Anyway, there is this "rocker/alt/indie/im badass/emo/ girl at my school, who made fun of me for turning up the radio when "ocean breathes salty" came on...she's like, "im sure you just love all these radio songs. you haven't heard anything good from modest mouse"...her "support" was the non-radio songs from Good News, and Moon and Antarctica. She didnt even know modest mouse had more than two cds. I just laughed. But I will continue to love this band even if doing so has become slightly more difficult as of late. Its about the music anyway favorite songs from this cd: - ocean breathes salty ( great brooding and symbolic lyrics a la moon and antarctica, though the "that is that" hoook gets annoying given its constancy on radio) - the view ( upbeat pop sounds, mixed with the screaming vocals that get more back to roots that most of the songs on this cd "your gun went off, well you shot off your mouth and look where it got you"...the "awful feels softer" hook is entrancing - bury me with it (good simply for its lyrics at the end "good news for people who love bad news...we are hummingbirds who've lost the plot and will not move...) - Black Cadillacs ( a good song in its lyrics , though the downside is this doesnt sound like the modest mouse i know) probably worth 4 stars or so, i give it 5 since i am a diehard, biased modest mouse fan. 
A10WUME856PDHY B00008PHCZ July 6, 2003 4 4 5.0 i knew it was good, but wow I'd forgotten just how many of the great episodes took place during the first two seasons. On this DVD you've got "Three Men and Adena," "Gone for Goode," and "Black and Blue," which are to my mind three of the best episodes I've seen. Most series take a season or two to really hit their stride, but "Homicide" was great from the get go. In fact as good as seasons three through five were, I'd have to say that I like the show best in these early episodes. When they started ignoring Ned Beatty to focus on Braugher's character it lost a little something, I liked Pembleton but Bolander was just as interesting to me, and it started to get a little gimmicky by season five or so. My only complaint about the DVDs is that the sound leaves just a little to be desired. Sure, sometimes I think they want it to be hard to hear, but there are other times where I think the sound is just a little murky for no real reason. Despite this little caveat it's still and excellent set. 
A10WVAH33PD2S3 1573929778 January 1, 2006 4 4 3.0 A very challenging read , but I loved parts of it.-3-1/2 stars The first two chapters are very challenging if you don't have any background in philosophy or physics,While some of the other chapters are very accessible to the avg. reader.In my opinion this is not an introductory book to atheism or the arguments against theism.If you have read some other books of this genre and you enjoy a challenge there is much to like about this book. Edis begins by showing how the god of the philosophers is such an abstraction that we don't even know what it is we are talking about."Not much to build a religion on" as he puts it.The problem for me was that for much of the chapter I didn't know what he was talking about,although the summarizations helped me out somewhat. His summarization of evolution was pretty good and I enjoyed this section, but my favorite sections were his summarization of the evolution of the myths of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.He gives a great synopsis of the latest biblical and New Testament scholarship, Even though he dismisses the Jesus myth theory too easily,I really liked this part of the book. In his chapter on physics he takes apart the arguments of theists and new agers trying to use science to bolster their claims.He takes on William Lane Craig's Kalam cosmological argument that states that anything that has a beginning must have a cause.Since the universe began to exist it must have been caused and this cause would obviously have to be the god of the bible.How convenient that this argument exempts God from having to be explained by a cause.Edis dismantles these and similar arguments explaining that"the standard big bang is the beginning of spacetime itself,not an event in time" and "the state arising from such a singularity is fundamentally random.At the singularity there is no physical law , no causation; the singularity itself stands uncaused." His chapter on good and evil and moral values is also very helpful in correcting the notion that without God(whose god?)we can have no ethics or morality and anything would be permissable.If those who claim that the Bible or the Koran contain absolute moral principles would actually read those books we would be better off.They would see what these man-made gods are really like and we could possibly move beyond such silliness. A difficult read in parts,but all in all I'm glad I bought it and I have referred back to it a time or two already. 
A10X0JN8KTK89H B00005JOWF March 5, 2006 3 6 1.0 Worse than Speed 2. Speed 2 was the only movie I ever walked out of. Out of sheer will, I stayed for the entirety of Ultraviolet. There is nothing at all redemptive about this movie. It manages the impossible by making Milla Jovovich un-sexy. She does not look like a real woman. Through the soft focus lens, her face appears as lamely computer-generated and un-textured as the rest of the film. Jovovich's unique face is composed of hard angles that create interesting shadows. Why would you mess with that? A toned midriff cannot carry a movie. Either Jovovich cannot act or she needs a new agent. The script was absolutely non-existent, but somehow William Fichtner (poor guy needs a new agent, too; he's a good actor) barely comes away clean. Everyone else in the film cannot makes heads or tails of their lines, and it is clear that they have no idea who their characters are, what they are doing, or why they are doing it. The music is mind-numbing and entirely uninteresting. If you like techno/trance/beat music, this is for you. The "action" sequences were all the same. Every single one. There was no tension prior to a fight scene. Everyone who challenged Violet either got in a circle or lined up to die. The universe of Ultraviolet exists without explanation, despite the attempt at exposition by Violet. The audience has no sense of why and how things work: Why do you need helicopters and helicopter blades in a world where motorcycles can defy gravity? Why do some characters have to carry around their guns and other ones can hide them in some sort of personal cyberspace? Perhaps most infuriating is the laziness of the film. There was no attempt to flesh out a story, just buzzwords like "virus" and "vampires." Maybe the director and producers thought the audience hadn't seen Underworld, it's sequel, Aeon Flux, and The Matrix. Or maybe they did, and that's why they didn't bother to tell a different story or to even tell a story at all. It's been done before, and it's been done much better. 
A10X0JN8KTK89H B000E33VWW March 3, 2006 4 5 4.0 Great performances by Hoffman, Keener, and Collins, Jr. The success of this film relies heavily on the performances of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote, Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, and Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith. This film is a dramatized biopic of Capote's relationship with convicted killer Perry Smith, which leads Capote to write In Cold Blood, arguably the first nonfiction novel. I admit that I initially thought Hoffman was mocking Capote's sexual orientation and effeminate mannerisms. But Hoffman was very true to the real Capote, and as the movie progressed, I believed Hoffman's performance completely. Keener gives an understated performance as Harper Lee. She is at once Capote's companion, fellow author, admirer, and mother figure. Given that there are long periods in the film when Lee is not with Capote, Keener's ability to make Lee's influence on Capote felt is a credit to both Keener and Hoffman. Collins, Jr. nearly steals the movie. His complex performance as Perry Smith hits every emotion perfectly. The chemistry between Collins, Jr. and Hoffman is spectacular. Although Hoffman is the film's star and Capote was certainly a self-centered man, the viewer believes wholeheartedly that Capote would sympathize with Smith and even fall in love with him; thus, it's very appropriate that Hoffman lets Collins, Jr. take control of pivotal scenes. Capote's proximity to the subjects of his work challenges the "nonfiction-ness" of In Cold Blood, but no one can say that the novel isn't a book of truth. Likewise, the viewer of this film perhaps comes away somewhat confused about the moral character of Capote, but this in no way detracts from the truths about Capote in this wonderful film. 
A10X0JN8KTK89H B00005ATQF March 2, 2006 3 4 5.0 The Psychology of War Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is one of the greatest wars films ever made. The film stands with and apart from Kubrick's anti-war films, Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove. Full Metal Jacket takes its subject seriously. It's not interested in sensation and artifice; rather, the film is interested in the young men who train to be killers and go into other countries to do terrible things. To claim that the film doesn't have some element of anti-war theme would be disingenuous, but the psychological reality of war is darkly documented here. It appears that Kubrick lifted and borrowed from sources other than the novel The Short Timers, on which the film is based. Familiar elements are given new life under Kubrick's wonderful direction. I am somewhat annoyed that this version is full screen and not wide screen. Other Kubrick films from this collection were not even re-mastered (the video of the 2001: A Space Odyssey DVD was very grainy). This version of Full Metal Jacket appears to have been re-mastered, but go for the wide screen version if you can find it. 
A10X0JN8KTK89H 0618002219 April 18, 2004 1 1 4.0 Read if you are considering the world of The Hobbit I approached The Hobbit at the age of 25. Never having read anything by Tolkien and being recently uninspired by the overrated trilogy, I decided to read for myself--what's the big deal here? The Hobbit is not a comfort book for me. Since I didn't read it as a child, I don't have fond memories to draw me back. I can, however, somewhat empathize with those who do read and re-read this charming tale. The Hobbit takes the reader on a trip over wide landscapes, mostly from the perspective of a gentle nobody, Bilbo Baggins. Tolkien works hard to reveal characters as different types of people. Hobbits, Dwarves, Wizards, Dragons, Trolls, Goblins, Eagles, Wolves, Elves, Spiders, and Humans all represent some type of human condition. The young reader of The Hobbit will not realize that he or she is quite possibly being exposed to every type of person he or she will ever meet. Let us thank Tolkien. Tolkien gives the same breadth to the landscapes of adjacent but strange lands and the inhabitants therein. The land fits into Tolkien's environmentalist sensibility very pointedly. That is, this isn't a purely fantastical story--neither is the Lord of the Rings Trilogy--and that's what makes Tolkien's work so wonderful. Like C.S. Lewis--they were friends, in fact--Tolkien is able to pour morality, politics, philosophy, and spirituality into his works without mocking or tricking the reader. If you have not read The Hobbit, please do. You'll enjoy the trip. 
A10X0JN8KTK89H 0312171641 March 30, 2001 14 15 4.0 Good stories with commentaries by their writers Ann Charters has done a wonderful job of compiling a variety of great works of short fiction. There's Oates, Chekhov, Borges, Updike, Bierce, Carver, Cheever, and MANY others. There is also an extended amount of commentary on the works themselves. You'll read about Flannery O'Connor's "Reasonable Use of the Unreasonable," John Cheever's "Why I Write Short Stories," and more. You often get a candid response from writers about not only their writing, but other writers as well. It is a very nice touch. Before each story, there is a small biography of the writer, often informing the reader about the origin of the story that follows. Last, the appendices to the book are quite good as well. They cover the basic "Elements of Fiction" and "A Brief History of the Short Story" as well as a glossary of literary terms that are handy for students of short fiction and helpful for those simply interested in the technique behind the art. The book doesn't pretend to present everything about short fiction, but gives you a taste for the good stuff out there. 
A10X3S8SDWOS30 B00008IOQZ January 12, 2006 5 5 5.0 Easy to assemble, install, and use! Excellent for the mobile person I just purchased the Cannon Pixma IP90 Printer and needed it to be a mobile printer. This product was the answer to all of my needs. It was easy to assemble right out of the box. Assembly consisted of opening up the housing and inserting the battery. You then attached the housing/battery pack to the back of the printer and tightened it up with very large screws that were attached to the battery pack. You then have the option to attach the supplied cradle which will hold the printer in an upright position and plug in the ac adapter which came with the printer to the battery pack to charge it or you can leave the stand off and lay the printer down and attach the ac adapter that way. The intial charge on the dead battery took a couple of hours but after that you are good to go. The battery lasts pretty long as well. 
A10X3S8SDWOS30 B0000DEWAZ October 8, 2005 2 2 5.0 Great bag and stylish too no one knows its my diaper bag! This bag is awsome. I bought this bag because I am a very busy person and just wanted a bag that I could just throw on and this is it. This bag has enough room for a lot of stuff and the compartments are so thought out including the thermal bottle holder on the side. The bottle holder will hold an 8oz bottle and it zips shut. There is also a mesh bottle holder on the side of the bag for my pepsi that I never leave home without (need that caffeine). This bag is the best diaper bag I have ever owned and I am extremely happy with it. But it you wont be dissapointed. 
A10X56XICXHDWY 0792148223 June 29, 2000 8 9 5.0 Data a traitor? Part I left off with Picard, Geordi, and Troi surrounded by the Borg, and they find out that Lore is involved, and so is Data. Data is being controled by Data. Data takes Geordi's visor away from him, and later Commander Data does some experiments on him. we find out that these particular Borgs' are separted from the collective, and we see Hue is there. (Hue was once rescued by the Enterprise crew, and the crew instead of sending him back to the collective with self-destruct computer codes to destroy the Borg, Picard and the crew are sympathetic and send him back, with computer program on indivduality.) This disorients the Borg, and have turned to Lore who will be their leader, and bring order to them. Picard, Troi, and LaForge, escape and break the control Lore and on Data. Once free from Lore's control, Data fights with Lore, and defeats him. Data is forced to destroy Lore. Hue and the rest of the Borg on that planet try and find order with their lives. 
A10XIE96GGH53T 0156027321 November 20, 2003 16 42 1.0 an ode to mediocrity okay, enough of the five star reviews from people who never learned to read. this book fails in all respects. if you find a copy of this book just laying around,take it and burn it immediately for the sake of humanity. 
A10XIE96GGH53T 0876855575 November 9, 2003 5 8 3.0 an entertaining page turner, but nothing more i don't know why Bukowski is so popular. sure, he writes simply without any affectation, and all the scatological humor has probably gained him a huge following in the 15-25 yr. old demographic, but apart from that, there's nothing here that makes you go WOW! i guess in bukowski's world, the truth is always disgusting and disturbing, and the individual must plod ahead through the chaos of filth and decay if he is to discover anything meaningful. well, that's a good philosophy, but honestly, making references to crap, masturbation, etc. does get repetitive after a while. and why is this edition so big and expensive? seriously, this book good have been condensed into a smaller and cheaper two hundred page volume. this book definitely ain't worth sixteen bucks. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000F8DBDK April 24, 2006 3 3 5.0 This Is A Movie To Treasure I have just seen a little gem of a movie that is so wonderful and so uplifting, that I simply must say something about it. It's "The World's Fastest Indian," starring Anthony Hopkins in the true story about Burt Munro, a 60-ish man from New Zealand who owns a 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle, and, in the mid-1960's, travels to America with his Indian to fulfill his lifelong dream of setting a landspeed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The odds are against Burt every step of the way, as he has very little money, a heart condition, and virtually no knowledge of American customs. But Burt is such a likeable, upbeat fellow with such a great can-do attitude, that he perseveres, and makes many friends along the road to Bonneville with his beloved "motorsickle." This is a truly outstanding movie that tells a truly inspiring story of a man who refuses to give up on his dream, and it's a great story that the entire audience can connect with, whether you're into motorcycles or not. It's got a great script (with *many* memorable lines, both funny and touching), and it's brilliantly directed by Roger Donaldson, with Anthony Hopkins simply charming, delightful, and magnificent as Burt Munro. The only other big names you may know in the cast are Diane Ladd as a lonely widow, and comedian Paul Rodriguez as a car salesman who both meet Burt during his journey. Both are excellent in their supporting roles, as are the rest of the cast, who are primarily unknown actors, but they all shine, too, giving their very best next to Hopkins by playing such a terrific array of colorful, memorable characters that Burt meets along the way. And although there are really only a handful of racing scenes in the movie, when they do come, they are truly adrenaline-pumping.I saw "The World's Fastest Indian" at my local art-house movie theater, where it played for nearly three months on pure word-of-mouth power. I loved the film so much that I saw it four times. And all four times, as previous reviewers have remarked, the audience broke out in applause at the end. This movie is such a winning, inspirational crowd-pleaser, and it's one of those rare movies that anybody and *everybody* can like and get something out of. And let me say to you once again that you do not have to be a motorcycle enthusiast to appreciate this film. Because, in the end, "The World's Fastest Indian" is not about the motorcycle. It's about the man, his dream, and his incredible journey to fulfilling that dream. "The World's Fastest Indian" is a movie to treasure. Congratulations to director Roger Donaldson, Anthony Hopkins, the rest of the cast and crew, and the winning spirit of Burt Munro himself for making one of THE greatest feel-good films of all time. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002JEV November 18, 2004 23 23 5.0 Zeppelin: Live At The BBC Led Zeppelin's "BBC Sessions" is a great treasure trove of live material the group recorded for the BBC between 1969 and 1971. Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones and John Bonham were one of the rock world's greatest live acts, as this live set clearly shows. Granted, several songs are repeated, like "Communication Breakdown" (3 versions), "You Shook Me" and "I Can't Quit You Baby" (2 versions), but who's complaining? One of Zeppein's live trademarks was never to perform any song the exact same way, so each version of "Communication Breakdown," for example, differs somewhat from the other versions, as the band wanted to jam on it in a different, fresh way each time. And it works. Other goodies include a smokin' version of "Travelling Riverside Blues" (the rare studio version is only available on the 4-CD "Led Zeppelin" box set, but this live BBC version is just as good), and a brilliant performance of Zeppelin's signature song, "Stairway To Heaven." I also love the band's extended workouts on display here, including an 18 1/2 minute jam on "Dazed And Confused" (with Page getting some truly wild sounds out of his guitar), and the nearly 14-minute blast through "Whole Lotta Love," in which Zeppelin also insert some blues favorites like "Boogie Chillin'" and "That's Alright Mama." So, what are you waiting for, Zepheads---"BBC Sessions" totally deserves a place in your Led Zeppelin collection. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B0000AQOQG October 28, 2004 4 4 5.0 Happy Birthday, Association! It was 1968, and The Association, hot off the success of their third album, "Insight Out," and it's monster hit single, "Windy," went back into the studio and recorded their fourth album, "Birthday." Once again, this classy sextet deliver some of the best flower-power pop-rock ever made. These catchy, melodic songs are truly awesome, highlighted by the band's expert musical chemistry and vocal harmonies. The album includes more Association classics as "Like Always," "Everything That Touches You," "Time For Livin'," and "Time It Is Today," but also such great buried treasures like the punchy "Come On In," the beautiful "Rose Petals, Incense And A Kitten" (a silly title, I know, but the song is truly gorgeous), the equally exquisite "Toymaker," the haunting "Barefoot Gentleman," and the excellent "Bus Song," featuring a great bit of barbershop vocalising in the middle. When it comes to pop-rock, The Association were (and are) true geniuses. "Birthday" is a brilliant album, one of the band's best. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000003S0M September 10, 2004 1 2 5.0 Another Crimson Classic 1974's "Starless And Bible Black" is the second King Crimson album to feature bassist/singer John Wetton, drummer Bill Bruford and violinist David Cross alongside band leader/guitar wiz Robert Fripp, and it's a great one. Powerful, bone-crunching prog-rock from start to finish, including such Crimson classics as "The Great Deceiver," "Lament," "The Mincer," the epic title track, and the even more epic finale, "Fracture," with the band's performances throughout simply monstrous. A killer slab of classic progressive rock, "Starless And Bible Black" is one of King Crimson's best albums. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B0001XAMKO August 13, 2004 27 34 4.0 3 Stars For "A" Album, But 4 Stars For CD/DVD Package 1980's "A" is a very controversial Jethro Tull album. It started out as a solo album for Tull leader Ian Anderson, who brought in ace keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson, drummer Mark Craney and bassist Dave Pegg to help him record it. But Anderson *also* brought in Tull guitarist Martin Barre to play on the album, which was to have a major impact on what would happen next. With his solo album finished, Anderson delivered it to the record company execs at Chrysalis Records. Upon hearing it, the Chrysalis bigwigs *strongly* advised Anderson to release the album under the Jethro Tull name. Before Anderson could make a proper decision about it, Chrysalis went ahead and announced to the press that "A" was the new Jethro Tull album, featuring a new lineup. Thus, Tull veterans Barriemore Barlow, John Evan, and David Palmer were no longer in the band. As Anderson says in the new liner notes, the trio were "understandably and rightfully p----d off."But what of the "A" album itself? Well, to be perfectly honest, "A" (for Anderson, in case you're curious) is my least favorite Jethro Tull album, but it certainly isn't bad. Half of the songs are quite strong: "Crossfire," "Flyingdale Flyer," "Black Sunday," "4.W.D. (Low Ratio)" and the brilliant "Working John Working Joe" (by far the album's best song) are all excellent Tull rockers. The rest of the songs on "A" are decent and listenable, but...well...they just lack something. They don't grab me. In other words, they kinda go in one ear and out the other. Still, at the end of the day, 5 great songs out of 10 ain't bad, and the band's performances are consistently good. "A" isn't a Tull masterpiece, but it's good enough. So, my rating for Jethro Tull's "A" album alone: 3 stars. However....this new re-issue of "A" comes with a very special bonus treat: a DVD of Tull's 1980 concert & music video feature, "Slipstream"! Half of the DVD is Tull captured live in concert on their 1980 tour for "A," with Anderson & the gang in excellent form on such Tull favorites as "Songs From The Wood," "Heavy Horses," "Aqualung" and "Locomotive Breath," as well as songs from "A" like "Black Sunday." The other half contains some of Jethro Tull's very few forays into music video, including the hilarious clip for "Too Old To Rock 'N' Roll, Too Young To Die," "Sweet Dream" (featuring Anderson as a vampire!), and the simple-but-effective clip for "Dun Ringill." If you're a Tull fan, the "Slipstream" DVD is an absolute must-have. So, 3 stars for the "A" album, and a perfect 5 stars for the "Slipstream" DVD, giving the "A" CD/DVD deluxe package a final rating from yours truly of 4 stars. Granted, the "A" re-issue costs a little more thanks to the inclusion of the DVD, but it's definitely worth getting. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000294S52 July 14, 2004 13 13 5.0 The Best Of Paul & Helen A new greatest hits album put out by popular demand, "Jazzmasters: The Smooth Cuts" collects some of the best vocal tracks that composer/multi-instrumentalist Paul Hardcastle has recorded over the years, mostly with his most-frequent Jazzmasters singing partner, the soulful Helen Rogers (though two tracks on the album feature other singers). These songs are brilliant, catchy, and, of course, *smooth*. Many popular Hardcastle/Helen Rogers songs are featured, including "London In Springtime," "Lifetime," "Wonderland," "Runnin' Back," "Down So Low," and "Emerald Stardust," as well as the awesome covers of America's "Ventura Highway," and Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams." Also included is the beautifully heartfelt "You May Be Gone" (sung by Steve Menzies), and the groovy "It Must Be Love" (sung by Jaki Graham). Obviously, as there's only so much room on a single CD, there are other favorite Hardcastle tracks with vocals that are NOT included, such as "Don't Let It Get You Down," "Sounds Of Summer," "Got To Be Love," "Livin' In The Shadows," the cool cover of Pink Floyd's "Money," and many others. Nevertheless, "Jazzmasters: The Smooth Cuts" is a heavenly sampling of the heavenly smooth jazz music of Paul Hardcastle, with the lovely voice of Helen Rogers featured on most of the tracks. If you're a newcomer to Paul's music, this is a great CD to start with. I recommend it most highly! 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002VNU June 24, 2004 11 12 5.0 Alan Parsons' "Solo" Project The Alan Parsons Project's last official album was 1987's "Gaudi." After this, Alan Parsons worked with his Project partner Eric Woolfson one last time on Woolfson's 1990 album, "Freudiana," before the duo finally went their separate ways. Three years later, Parsons returned to recording with his first "solo" album, "Try Anything Once." No longer using the "Project" name, Parsons' 1993 disc still sounds very much like a Project album, with Parsons' magical touch in producing outstanding progressive pop-rock firmly intact, along with the aid of ace studio musicians, including longtime Project members Ian Bairnson on guitar & Stuart Elliot on drums, and a strong cast of revolving lead singers, this time augmented by David Pack of Ambrosia, Chris Thompson of Manfred Mann, and Eric Stewart of 10CC. Parsons also accepts songwriting contributions from some of his collaborators on the album. A solid full hour of classic Alan Parsons music, "Try Anything Once" will not disappoint Parsons' longtime fans.Things get rolling to a great start with "The Three Of Me," sung and co-written by David Pack. "Turn It Up," sung by Chris Thompson, is an instant Parsons classic, a great anthem that's guaranteed to get your heart pumping. Eric Stewart sings lead on the brilliantly super-smooth "Wine From The Water." The instrumental "Breakaway" follows, written by Parsons, and it's a terrific cross between "I Robot" and "Where's The Walrus?". "Mr. Time" gets the powerful female voice of Jacque Copland, and it's a blazing 8-minute piece of exciting prog pop-rock. "Jigue" is a giddy little instrumental, followed by the catchy number "I'm Talkin' To You," sung by Pack. Eric Stewart returns for the gorgeous "Siren Song," which easily recalls the classic Parsons nugget "To One In Paradise." The brief, peaceful instrumental "Dreamscape" then gives way to the tough, swaggering number, "Back Against The Wall," another great album highlight and sung by Thompson. "Re-Jigue" is obviously a reprise of "Jigue," only this time with a thunderous full orchestra, courtesy of longtime Parsons conductor & orchestrator Andrew Powell. Finally, David Pack returns to sing the triumphant concluding song, "Oh Life (There Must Be More)." The music is sensational, as is the album's production & sound. And although Eric Woolfson's presence is missed, "Try Anything Once" shows that Alan Parsons is getting on with his musical career just fine. In fact, "Try Anything Once" was the very first album that Parsons actually *toured* behind, finally stepping out of the recording studio at long last to bring his fans fantastic live performances of his music with a cracking live band. And, very happily, he's been touring ever since. The music goes on for Alan Parsons with "Try Anything Once," a dazzling addition to your Alan Parsons CD collection, with or without the Project name. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000005RW7 June 9, 2004 5 5 5.0 A Brilliant Concept Album In 1984, multi-talented singer/songwriter/musician Tony Carey released his second album under the group name Planet P Project, "Pink World," a sprawling concept album about a mysterious young boy named Artemus who saves the human race (or, at least, a large chunk of it) from a nuclear holocaust. Comparisons between this album and Pink Floyd's classic epic "The Wall" are inevitable, as "Pink World" has a very Floydian/"Wall" feel to it in both it's sound and structure (and even the acoustic number "A Boy Who Can't Talk" sounds like a total re-working of the acoustic Floyd favorite from "The Wall," "Mother"). But make no mistake, "Pink World" IS a phenomenal album, with an intriguing story, powerful, dramatic music, and outstanding production. Many of the album's songs and soundbites linger in the mind long afterwards, such as "To Live Forever," the title song, "What I See," "Power," "Behind The Barrier," "In The Zone," the instrumental "March Of The Artemites," "One Star Falling," "Baby's At The Door," and the already-mentioned "A Boy Who Can't Talk." This is truly wonderful progressive rock from beginning to end.My only disappointment with the CD edition of "Pink World" is that there's no lyric sheet in the booklet. Some parts of the plot are still a little bit unclear to me, such as the question of just who IS little Artemus, where did he come from, and where does he go to at the album's end? So, a complete set of lyrics would've been *most* appreciated! Still, there's no denying the tremendous acheivement that "Pink World" is. That Tony Carey created this rock opera virtually single-handedly (with only the odd bit of help from studio musicians) is truly a testament to the man's talents, and I greatly congratulate him. 20 years after it's original release, Planet P Project's "Pink World" still stands today as a magnificent entry in progressive rock music. Like Tony Carey sings in the title song, "It rolls like an avalanche, and it will sweep you away." 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B0000AQOQH May 23, 2004 7 7 5.0 An Association Appreciation The Association are one of the most underacknowledged brilliant bands from the late 60's/early 70's. Oh sure, these guys had several big hit singles through 1968 ("Windy" being the best-known of the lot), but come 1969, the public's interest in The Association was waning, which is a total shame if you ask me. After all, these guys from Los Angeles have created some of the most beautiful pop/rock that has ever been done. (There's also a marvelous art-rock feel to some of their material---"Requiem For The Masses" is a perfect example.) Their tight musical chops & intelligent songwriting alone is worth the price of admission, but then, there's also their heavenly choir voices....aaaah. Pure vocal magic. The Association may be best known for their early ballads, but these domestic re-issues of their catalog prove beyond a doubt that there is so much more to this band than just their "Greatest Hits" collection.I can't believe the whole world totally missed the boat on the group's fabulous self-titled album from 1969. "The Association" marked the beginning of the downward arc for the band commercially: there were no hit singles, and record sales weren't too hot, either. But *creatively*, the band had never been better. I love all of their earlier albums, but "The Association" is the group's finest work. By this time, the band had branched out into creating songs that were a bit more sophisticated and arty. In fact, the group sound on this album like a cross between The Moody Blues & The Alan Parsons Project! Even the album cover, with it's striking "Stonehenge in outer space" painting, signaled that The Association were doing something very different indeed with this record. And it's magnificent.Gorgeous songs abound everywhere: "Love Affair," "The Nest," "Under Branches," and the brilliant album-closer, "Boy On The Mountain," which almost brings me to tears whenever I hear it. "Yes I Will" & "Are You Ready" are really catchy songs that *should* have been big hits. And then there's "Broccoli"---it is what it is, folks. If this wonderfully silly song doesn't put a smile to your face, then you must not have a sense of humor! The door may have been closing on The Association by the time 1969 rolled around, but the band were still at the top of their game musically. "The Association" is a fabulous album by this equally fabulous band, and is a true buried musical treasure. Yes, there IS more to The Association than just "Windy." 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B00005OLD5 May 6, 2004 5 5 5.0 The Ultimate Fixx Despite the fact that it didn't match the commercial success of "Reach The Beach," this third album by the Fixx, 1984's "Phantoms," is the group's masterpiece. The band's atmospheric pop-rock works to maximum effect on this album, and there's not a single song here that I don't like. GREAT hooks & melodies everywhere you look, with such classic Fixx rockers as "Less Cities, More Moving People," "Sunshine In The Shade," "Woman On A Train," and the Top 40 hit "Are We Ourselves?", as well as "Lose Face" and "Question." The band also score major points with the softer tunes, including "Wish," the dreamy "Facing The Wind," and the absolutely beautiful number, "I Will" (and why this very lovely song was never released as a single I will never know---the Fixx could've had another huge hit along the lines of "One Thing Leads To Another"). The band's performances are sharp, and Cy Curnin's passionate voice is excellent. Their record sales may have begun to decline with this one, but in my mind, it was the fault of radio and the record-buying public for missing out on this great disc. "Phantoms" is an outstanding Fixx album, with some of the best 80's pop-rock ever laid down. It's the best work Cy Curnin & company have ever done, so what are you waiting for? Pick it up, and enjoy the ultimate Fixx. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000A2H2UO January 17, 2006 3 3 4.0 Gentle Giant Live! Gentle Giant's 1977 release, "Playing The Fool," is a double-live set (though, at 78 minutes, it thankfully squeezes onto a single CD!). It's a great live document of the group, showing off the band's tight musicianship and knack for experimentation (such as those giddy-sounding flutes on "Excerpts From Octopus" and the amazing performance on vibes during "Funny Ways," not to mention John Weathers' outstanding drum solo on "So Sincere"). Gentle Giant's odd time signatures, vocals & arrangements may be an acquired taste, but these guys were a great, very unique group, and "Playing The Fool" is a very solid live set. If you're a newer Gentle Giant fan who never got to see them live (like myself), then this album is the closest thing you'll get to experiencing the group in concert, while for longtime fans who *were* fortunate enough to attend the gigs all those years ago, "Playing The Fool" serves as a great slice of nostalgia. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002VEP April 12, 2004 11 11 5.0 Alan Parsons' "Project" Goes Out In Style 1987's "Gaudi" was the last collaboration between Alan Parsons and his musical partner Eric Woolfson under the "Alan Parsons Project" name. An album inspired by the life and works of architect Antonio Gaudi, "Gaudi" is a very rich, elegant, powerful album for the Project to go out with. "La Sagrada Familia" is a beautiful orchestral rock epic, with a great lead vocal by John Miles. Longtime Project vocalist Lenny Zakatek takes the mike on "Too Late," an awesome pop-rocker that could've been (and should've been) a huge hit for the group, though it wasn't released as a single. Eric Woolfson sings on "Closer To Heaven," a very beautiful, heavenly Project number. The lone single release from the album, "Standing On Higher Ground," is a very cool, catchy tune, sung by Geoff Barradale of the mid-80's group Vitamin Z (remember them?). John Miles returns for another lead vocal on "Money Talks," which is a great, down & dirty rocker. Woolfson then returns once more for the lovely "Inside Looking Out," and the album concludes on a very high note with a short instrumental reprise of "La Sagrada Familia," featuring excellent spanish guitar by Project veteran Ian Bairnson. As always on a Project album, the performances, production and sound quality are sharp & superior, and the outstanding orchestral touches by Andrew Powell is the icing on an already delicious musical cake.Alan Parsons did, in fact, work with Eric Woolfson one last time on Woolfson's 1990 concept album, "Freudiana," before the duo finally went their separate ways ("Freudiana" is only available on import, but it's an absolutely brilliant, MUST-buy CD for diehard Project fans). Parsons has since gone solo (though he's retained the services of several Project members for his latest albums), while Woolfson has since gone into the world of musical theater, writing & producing several musicals that have been performed throughout Europe. But these two men have created together some of the most fantastic music I've ever heard (and are STILL making fantastic music on their own these days), and "Gaudi" is a gorgeous, dazzling, memorable album to close out the Alan Parsons Project with. Thank you Alan, Eric, and the rest of the Project gang---long live the Project! 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002GQL March 28, 2004 11 11 5.0 ...And On The Seventh Album, The Moodies Rested... By the time the Moody Blues had released their seventh album in five years, 1972's "Seventh Sojourn," the band were absolutely exhausted, both personally and creatively. After the tour for the album was finished the following year, the Moodies took an extended five-year break before reuniting for 1978's "Octave." But before the temporary stop in activity, the Moodies summoned up what creative energy they had left and put it into this wonderful, classic album. You'd never guess that the band were feeling any stress whatsoever, because "Seventh Sojourn" is simply brilliant, one of the Moodies' very best works. Song for song it is a stunner. Keyboardist Mike Pinder contributes two of his most haunting Moody Blues songs ever, "Lost In A Lost World" and "When You're A Free Man." The trio from guitarist Justin Hayward are all winners: the gorgeous "New Horizons," the bouncy "You And Me," and the charming "Land Of Make-Believe." Bassist John Lodge gets the honor of penning the two classic singles from the album, the dramatic ballad "Isn't Life Strange," and the awesome rocker "I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band)." And flautist Ray Thomas contributes one of his all-time greatest numbers, the lovely "For My Lady." Only drummer Graeme Edge passed on writing any songs for the album, but he more than makes up for that with some of the most powerful drumming he ever laid down with the group.Having toured relentlessly, and having created in a short five years an impressive catalogue of albums known by many fans the world over as "The Classic Seven"---and, with "Seventh Sojourn" becoming a #1 smash on the U.S. album chart---the Moody Blues had definitely earned their extended holiday as a recording act. Thank goodness that they returned to duty in 1978 and have been active ever since, but they couldn't have made a better album to rest on than "Seventh Sojourn." It's a glorious Moody Blues album, one of the group's finest achievements. If you gotta go out---even if it's only temporarily---than go out on top. The Moody Blues ended the first phase of their work together *definitely* at the top of the mountain with "Seventh Sojourn." 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B0000025DN March 4, 2004 7 8 3.0 A Good Debut The band that famously combines classical influences with Beatle-esque pop/rock, the Electric Light Orchestra debuted in 1972 with their album, "No Answer," and it's definitely a good album, though it would take the band a couple more albums to truly find their way. "No Answer" is the only ELO album to feature Roy Wood, and he splits the songwriting duties on the album with former Move bandmate Jeff Lynne, who would later become ELO's definitive bandleader after Wood's departure. As it turns out, Lynne's songs on "No Answer" are stronger than Wood's. "10538 Overture" remains an all-time ELO classic, and Lynne also lends the fine, melodic "Nellie Takes Her Bow," "Mr. Radio," the piano-thumping "Manhattan Rumble," and "Queen Of The Hours." Of Wood's contributions, the best one is the acoustic instrumental "1st Movement," which sounds like a re-working of Mason Williams' famous piece, "Classical Gas," but it's excellent. The rest of Wood's songs are good---the string-arranged "Look At Me Now" is a standout---but they just don't hold a candle to the expert melodies of Lynne's songs. Also on the debit side is that some of the orchestral arrangements sound a little awkward, and the album's sound quality is a bit muddy. Still, the album does have it's share of good songs, and if you're a diehard ELO fan, than "No Answer" is certainly worth getting. It's a good, promising debut from a band that were definitely destined for the big time. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002OX5 February 2, 2004 22 26 5.0 The Who's Psychedelic Radio Show The Who's third album, 1967's "The Who Sell Out," was the band's very first concept album, the theme for the record being a pirate radio station that plays nothing but Who songs, complete with radio jingles & commercials (some genuine, some created by the band) sprinkled inbetween the tunes. It's a brilliant, fabulously inventive, totally *psychedelic* Who album, and one of the band's all-time greats. The festivities kick off with a "Monday Thru Sunday" jingle, and then the band charge in with the far-out gem, "Armenia City In The Sky," penned by guitarist Pete Townshend's chum John Keene, featuring elongated horns, psychedelic guitars, and a studio-tweaked vocal from Roger Daltrey. Pete Townshend's songwriting contributions to "Sell Out" are all gems, too, every single one of them: "Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand," the hilarious "Odorono," the coming-of-age tale "Tattoo," the lovely "Our Love Was," the legendary, explosive rocker "I Can See For Miles" (the Who's only US Top Ten hit), "I Can't Reach You," "Relax," "Sunrise," and the mini-opera "Rael" (with it's instrumental bridge later resurrected as the "Underture" from "Tommy"), while bassist John Entwistle delivers the hilarious jingles for "Heinz Baked Beans" & "Medac," as well as the macbre-ish tune, "Silas Stingy."But this remastered, expanded edition of "Sell Out" doesn't stop there: there's a whopping TEN bonus tracks of extra Who goodies recorded around the same time as the album. From Townshend's songwriting pen, there's the extended finale for "Rael," "Glittering Girl," the outstanding rocker "Melancholia," the slick rock of "Jaguar," an alternate version of "Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand," and the brilliant finale, "Glow Girl," which, like "Rael," was later raided & revised by Townshend for the "Tommy" album ("It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl"). Also featured is Entwistle's "Someone's Coming," drummer Keith Moon's charming little ditty, "Girl's Eyes," and the fine popper "Early Morning Cold Taxi" (for which Daltrey received a rare co-writing credit). There's even a fabulous, barnburning, King Crimson-like rock arrangement of Greig's "The Hall Of The Mountain King," plus more jingles. The musical chemistry of Daltrey, Townshend, Entwistle and Moon is nothing short of superb, and the remastered sound is simply incredible."The Who Sell Out" was a natural lead-in for "Tommy," as the album expanded Pete Townshend's interest in writing conceptual music. But it's also a mindblowing Who album all on it's own, one of the group's very best releases. So crank up "The Who Sell Out," and enjoy rocking out with the Who's marvelous psychedelic radio show. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B0000DZ3EA January 2, 2004 26 28 4.0 Great Gabriel Set, But Not Definitive Peter Gabriel's new 2-CD retrospective, "Hit," is certainly a great collection, spanning Gabriel's solo career from 1977 to the present. Many classic Gabriel cuts are here: "Solsbury Hill," "Games Without Frontiers," "Shock The Monkey," "Sledgehammer," "Digging In The Dirt," "Growing Up," and many others. There's also one previously unreleased song, the great rocker "Burn You Up Burn You Down" (a leftover track from the "Up" sessions), the awesome "Lovetown" (from the "Philadelphia" movie soundtrack), and three songs from Gabriel's import-only release, "OVO"---"The Tower That Ate People," "Father, Son," and a live rendition of "Downside Up" (featuring Gabriel in a duet with his daughter, Melanie). There's even the lovely track, "Cloudless," from Gabriel's "Rabbit-Proof Fence" movie soundtrack. A very good, more-than-satisfying Gabriel retrospective, to be sure. But NO songs at all from Gabriel's 2nd album (which just so happens to be my favorite Gabriel disc)? This is now the second time that Gabriel has snubbed his second album, as nothing from it was included on his earlier greatest hits CD, "Shaking The Tree." I tell you, folks, if I knew how to contact Peter Gabriel directly, I'd get him on the horn right now and say to him, "Look, Peter, you really need to stop ignoring your second album. It's a wonderful album, man, so be proud of it!" Also, nothing from Gabriel's soundtracks to the films "Birdy" or "The Last Temptation Of Christ" is represented, either, which is another unfortunate oversight.Nevertheless, "Hit" is stuffed full of magnificent Peter Gabriel music, clocking in at about 2 1/2 hours total, which is nothing to sneeze at. Whether you're a casual Gabriel fan or a diehard, this set is definitely worth purchasing. But what we Gabriel fans could *really* use right about now is a BOX SET, and one that features songs from ALL of Peter's albums, including the sorely overlooked second album. Peter certainly deserves a box set, and think of all those B-sides and rarities that would be on it, too...(*sigh*)...Well, until then, "Hit" will do for now. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002504 December 12, 2003 4 4 4.0 Tying Knots With Gentle Giant With new drummer John Weathers, who would remain with the band right to the end, Gentle Giant released their fourth album, 1973's "Octopus." It's another slice of GG's intricate "acquired taste" sort of progressive rock, but for those who are open to it--like me--it's great stuff. The band get some good jams in on tracks like "The Advent Of Panurge," "Knots," "The Boys Of The Band," and "River," as well as showing their softer side on the lovely, ballady "Think Of Me With Kindness." The band's musicianship is tight, the vocals are excellent. All in all, "Octopus" is yet another fine prog-rock album from the daring Gentle Giant. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B0000AVHCI November 16, 2003 11 18 5.0 Madrigal Fun With Ian "Rupi's Dance," the latest solo album from Jethro Tull leader Ian Anderson, is an excellent album that showcases Anderson's gift for storytelling, as well as his trademark flute & vocal abilities. He weaves some pretty fine tales here, such as his tributes to his current feline companion (the title song) and his recently-departed one ("Old Black Cat"), his fascination with a beautiful CNN reporter ("Not Ralitsa Vassileva"), perusing coffee shops ("Calliandra Shade"), taking vacations ("A Week Of Moments"), and the joys of photo developing ("Photo Shop"), among others. All the while, Ian's rich voice and sparkling flute (and acoustic guitar, too) shine brightly on the disc, with the album's mix of madrigal folk and rock very, very charming. And to sweeten the deal, Ian even includes a great bonus cut from Jethro Tull's Christmas album, "Birthday Card At Christmas," to round things off. What more could you ask for? Whether solo or with Jethro Tull, Ian Anderson is a musical genius that I will follow anywhere, and "Rupi's Dance" is a wonderful album from this most-excellent pied piper. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002IQ9 October 23, 2003 7 8 5.0 It's Phil's Show! "Serious Hits Live" documents Phil Collins' tour for his 1989 album, "But Seriously." As promised, this live album has Phil performing his biggest hits, including "You Can't Hurry Love," "Sussudio," "One More Night," "Easy Lover," and "Take Me Home." Phil proves for all to hear what a dynamic performer he & his band are live in concert. His earth-shattering performance of "In The Air Tonight" alone makes this CD worth getting, but overall this is a fabulous live set. It's Phil's show all the way, and you're invited! Enjoy. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU 0345325818 September 20, 2003 5 5 4.0 The Middle-Earth Bible If you love J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth saga of "The Hobbit" & "The Lord Of The Rings," then you absolutely MUST read "The Silmarillion." This book is the Middle-Earth bible, telling the stories of the First Age of Tolkien's mystical land, including the history of the Elves, long before Bilbo, Frodo, Gandalf & company came along at the end of the Third Age. "The Silmarillion" tells of the creation of the world, followed by the story of the Silmarills, three magic jewels of power that are stolen by the evil lord Morgoth, who was Sauron's predecessor and master, and the attempts by the Elves (and certain Men) to retrieve them. This is then briefly followed by a plot synopsis for "The Lord Of The Rings," so "The Silmarillion" really does contain all of Middle-Earth's history in a single volume. Also, quite happily, three characters from "The Lord Of The Rings" play major roles here: the evil Sauron, and the high-esteemed Elves Elrond and Galadriel, and it's quite fascinating to read how they all got their starts. Written off & on during his lifetime, but left unedited into a final form at the time of his death, Tolkien's son Christopher bravely took up the task of editing his father's unpublished work into a finished book, and he did an excellent job. Admittedly, "The Silmarillion" is a very challenging read---no Hobbits anywhere, and LOTS of names of people & places scattered all over, many of them similar-sounding (Turin son of Hurin, Elros brother of Elrond, etc., etc.), which can cause confusion for the reader at first and was one of the reasons why Tolkien was reluctant to have the work published. Fortunately, the book comes with a glossary of all these names and who's who, how to pronounce them, as well as maps of the various lands. But more than that, the book is wonderfully written, containing many great stories of drama & adventure as only Tolkien could write them (a great highlight for me is the story of Beren and Luthien, a marvelous love story AND adventure rolled into one, but there are many other examples).Thoroughly engrossing from beginning to end, "The Silmarillion" is essential reading for any Tolkien fan who wants to know how all of Middle-Earth began, and what the backstory and history is to the saga of "The Hobbit" & "The Lord Of The Rings." A marvelous book, and highly recommended to the Tolkien enthusiast. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000001FOX November 15, 2005 1 1 4.0 Going Deep With The Moodies After the big commercial success of their 1986 release, "The Other Side Of Life," the Moody Blues followed it up with 1988's "Sur La Mer" (or "On The Sea" in French), and while it can be said that "Sur La Mer" is basically a sequel album to "The Other Side Of Life"---glossy, polished Moodies music tailor-made for the 80's---this is an excellent Moody Blues album all the same. The proof is in the high quality of the songs, all written or co-written by singer/guitarist Justin Hayward and singer/bassist John Lodge, including the charming Top 40 hit "I Know You're Out There Somewhere," the great rock of "River Of Endless Love," the light & breezy "No More Lies," the lovely acoustic pop of "Vintage Wine," the dancefloor grooves of "Miracle," and the brilliant album-closer, Justin Hayward's "Deep," an outstanding and surprisingly *sultry* Moody Blues number (amazingly, the band have never played it live, but it's a firm, all-time personal favorite Moodies song of mine). The only debit to "Sur La Mer" is, although still listed on the album as a band member, flautist Ray Thomas, like he was on "The Other Side Of Life," is completely absent (once again, the band's explanation was that Ray didn't write anything for the album). But other than that, "Sur La Mer" is a highly enjoyable Moody Blues album with wonderful songs and performances from the band. It's great stuff! 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000001FJP August 28, 2003 7 7 4.0 Pop Goes The Moodies The Moody Blues' 1986 album, "The Other Side Of Life," is easily the most polished, radio-friendly offering in their whole catalog, but it's still a very good Moodies album, and I remain pleased to this day that it was a big hit for them, too, their last US Top Ten album. "The Other Side Of Life" has an 80's gloss of keyboards and synth drums, and yet, the music is still great fun, and the Moodies' knack for tuneful singing, songwriting and performing remains intact. Guitarist Justin Hayward's "Your Wildest Dreams" was the big hit song from the album, and it's a nice little number, but my favorite tracks on the disc are other songs that come from Justin's pen, including the excellent title song, which is a marvelously spooky 7 1/2 minute pop-rocker, the sweet "I Just Don't Care," and the catchy pop of "Running Out Of Love," co-written with bassist John Lodge. Also worth mentioning are "The Spirit," co-written by keyboardist Patrick Moraz & drummer Graeme Edge, and Lodge's fine power ballad finale, "It May Be A Fire." Excellent pop from beginning to end, "The Other Side Of Life" is a charming Moody Blues album. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000006ZZ6 July 31, 2003 2 2 5.0 Harum's Greatest Disc 1969's "A Salty Dog" is Procol Harum's masterpiece. The music here is simply wonderful, with the band's trademark blend of rock, blues, & classical worked to majestic perfection. The title track is unquestionably one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs ever written, with passionate vocals from keyboardist Gary Brooker. "The Milk Of Human Kindness" is great piano-rock, "Too Much Between Us" is a lovely acoustic number, "The Devil Came From Kansas" is a memorable Harum song with a strong, marching feel, and "Boredom" is just plain fun, with fine vocals from organist Matthew Fisher. "Juicy John Pink" is excellent dirty blues, "Wreck Of The Hesperus" is a powerful dramatic number, and "All This And More" is sharp, melodic pop/rock. Guitarist Robin Trower steps up to the microphone with gusto on the great slow rocker, "Crucifixion Land," and Fisher returns to the mike on the winning, whimsical finale, "Pilgrim's Progress." The songwriting, with lyrics by Keith Reid, and the band's performances are all outstanding. Procol Harum have many brilliant albums to their credit, but "A Salty Dog" is the one that moves me the most. It's a gorgeous Harum classic. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B00009VTYE July 4, 2003 72 74 5.0 The Greatest Rock Theater You'll Ever See Saturday, July 21, 1990 is a day I will never forget. Former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters & special guests performed a charity concert of the classic Floyd rock opera, "The Wall," at Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Germany, to celebrate the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. I just so happened to be in England at the time, and I watched the worldwide broadcast of this staggering rock concert on BBC TV that evening, and it left an impression on me that has never gone away. This phenomenal show was and IS the ultimate in rock theater, and has never been surpassed. Since I never got to see Pink Floyd perform "The Wall" live back in 1980, watching the Berlin concert more than made up for that. 13 years later, this landmark concert has finally been released on DVD at last, and it still holds up magnificently. Granted, Pink Floyd themselves had nothing to do with this concert, as Roger Waters was (and still is) not on good terms with his former bandmates, but Roger, the main composer of "The Wall," is in top form in this show, and he alligned himself that evening with some pretty huge names in music---Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, members of The Band, Bryan Adams, Sinead O'Connor, the Scorpions, Paul Carrack, James Galway, Ute Lemper, as well as 80's staples Cyndi Lauper & Thomas Dolby, and many more. Along with an orchestra & chorus conducted by Michael Kamen---as well as the Marching Band Of The Combined Soviet Forces---Roger & his own Bleeding Heart Band, including guitarists Rick DiFonzo & Snowy White, play this famous rock concept album superbly, and the vocal turns by Roger and all the guest vocalists are marvelous. The production values, including the mammoth Wall itself (reportedly measuring 550 feet wide and 82 feet high), the gargantuan inflatables of the Teacher and Pig characters, the colorful costumes, props, lighting effects, Gerald Scarfe animations and other provocative projections shown on the Wall itself are all absolutely astonishing. And when you see that mighty Wall come crashing down brick by brick at the concert's end, it is one of the most phenomenal sights you will ever see. "The Wall: Live In Berlin" is also outstanding in that it is probably the only concert ever staged that is actually *better* to watch on TV than if you had actually been there live. The camerawork throughout is amazing, and takes you places that the live audience couldn't go: into the specially-built living room in the high corner of the Wall as Roger sings "One Of My Turns" and "Don't Leave Me Now," behind the Wall as Paul Carrack sings "Hey You," and high atop the Wall as Difonzo & White do their awesome guitar solos on "Comfortably Numb."Admittedly, the video version of "The Wall: Live In Berlin" has a little bit of touch-up work done on it, or, what is affectionately known in the business as "cheating." The power went out early in the show during Ute Lemper's "The Thin Ice," Roger's "Another Brick In The Wall Part 1," and again during Sinead O'Connor's "Mother," so the performances you see of "The Thin Ice" & "Another Brick...Part 1" were actually shot several hours *after* the concert had ended, and "Mother" was taken from footage of the final rehearsal that was done the previous night (Roger's lack of sunglasses during these songs is the giveaway). Also, Ute's portrayal of The Wife during "The Trial" sequence was also shot *after* the concert, as the camera malfunctioned during her live performance. But it certainly goes without saying that these touch-up performances were absolutely necessary in order to present the show in it's entirety, and besides, they blend in with the genuine live performances very seamlessly.Following in the footsteps of Pete Townshend, who brought The Who's classic rock opera "Tommy" to the Broadway stage, Roger Waters has been working for many years on a "proper" theatrical staging of Pink Floyd's "The Wall." Whether or not "The Wall" ever makes it to Broadway still remains to be seen, but, at the very least, Roger successfully brought the live rendition of the album to the masses in this landmark concert, blessedly recorded for posterity to be enjoyed again and again. "The Wall: Live In Berlin" is one of the most sensational rock concerts ever staged, and is a must-own DVD for every fan of this legendary concept album. Thank you, Roger! 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B00000IPAC June 12, 2003 11 14 5.0 Dan's Logic Steely Dan's third album, 1974's "Pretzel Logic," was the last album the group made before co-leaders Walter Becker & Donald Fagen decided to quit touring altogether and make the recording studio their exclusive musical laboratory, using various top-notch session players to help them flesh out their latest creations. But first, there was still room for one more "band" recording (as well as a tour), with Walt & Don helped out by fellow members Denny Dias & Jeff "Skunk" Baxter on guitars, and Jim Hodder on drums. Without foregoing their flare for rock, "Pretzel Logic" finds Steely Dan in a looser, jazzier mode. There's an ace Duke Ellington cover on it ("East St. Louis Toodle-oo"), as well as a very hip salute to jazz great Charlie Parker ("Parker's Band"). And of course, more terrific, totally cool Dan numbers, with Fagen's trademark lyrical acid wit. The pop radio staple "Rikki Don't Lose That Number" was a big Top Five hit for the band (though I think Walt & Don are tired of it these days--they never play it live!). "Night By Night" is a classy, funky rocker. "Any Major Dude Will Tell You" is a lighter number but tremendously melodic, "Barrytown" has a great rollicking feel to it, "Through With Buzz" is brief but strong (with a clever string arrangement on top of it), and the title song is a swinging jazz throwdown. "With A Gun" is almost country, but has terrific, strumming acoustic guitar to drive it. "Charlie Freak" has a dark, almost ominous tone to it's piano line, but it certainly sticks with you, and the concluding "Monkey In Your Soul" is a great groover, with a memorable baseline that literally quakes. As always with Steely Dan, the band's musicianship cooks, the production is tremendous, and Fagen's lead vocals are soulful. "Pretzel Logic" is a classic Steely Dan album, one of the band's best. Make sure you don't lose this number, Rikki! 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002VC5 May 12, 2003 1 2 5.0 I, Parsons An instant classic, 1977's "I Robot" was the first big commercial breakthrough for The Alan Parsons Project. A themed album about Man's relation to machines & vice versa, it's a winning combination of both the Project's art-rock & pop sensibilities, and, being released in 1977, it even has a great *disco* feel to some of the tracks, like the funky hit "I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You," "The Voice," and the marvelous instrumental title track. More incredible music continues on other fine tracks like "Some Other Time," "Don't Let It Show," and the beautiful "Day After Day (The Show Must Go On)." And there's more great instrumental pieces in the breathtaking "Nucleus," the ominous "Total Eclipse," and the powerful "Genesis Ch.1 V.32." Great vocals abound from the likes of Allan Clarke, Steve Harley, Lenny Zakatek, the English Chorale & others, the songwriting by Parsons & Eric Woolfson is solid, and the group's musical chemistry is nothing short of supreme. The album's production work is simply amazing, and Andrew Powell's impressive orchestrations are the icing on the cake. One of the best recorded unions of prog & pop, the Alan Parsons Project's "I Robot" is an astonishing work. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B00008J2L9 April 5, 2003 8 8 5.0 The Amazing Ute In the world of singers, there are some singers who can do it all: sing, write, and play instruments. Then there are the singers who *strictly* sing, i.e. they don't write any of their own material, or play any instruments. They just sing, and that's it. You can just see them in the recording studio, and the producer says to him or her, "Just sing along to this pre-recorded track, baby, and we'll sell millions!" But I DO make exceptions for "strictly" singers who are unquestionably, without a doubt, 100% *phenomenal* at the microphone, whose passionate voices can instantly grab you & hold your attention, and who can make any song they sing completely their own. Frank Sinatra was such a singer. Tom Jones is such a singer. And, on the female side, German cabaret goddess Ute Lemper is such a singer. Ute Lemper is a magnificent, outstanding vocalist (AND stunningly gorgeous, which doesn't hurt either). Ute completely throws herself at the mike with tremendous passion, sensuality, and presence on every song she sings, quite often within the many characters of these songs. Ute Lemper doesn't just sing, she *performs*. If ever there was a woman who was born to sing, it's Ute Lemper. Her latest album, "But One Day," is quite possibly the best thing she's ever done. She serves up a marvelously sung collection of songs by Weill, Brel, Piazzolla, Heymann and Eisler, AND, in the nicest surprise of all, Lemper herself. She can now add "songwriter" to her list of talents, as she sings five songs of her own, a first for her. Ute's own compositions, including "I Surrender," and "Lena" (featuring Laurie Anderson), are excellent, emotional songs that perfectly showcase what she can do at the mike. And, as Lemper has proved many times before, she also knows how to wrap her silky voice around anything by the likes of Weill, Brel, or Piazzolla, like "Speak Low," "Buenos Aires," and "Amsterdam." The album's arrangements and production are both sparkly, and a perfect match for Lemper's commanding, sultry pipes. With her blossoming songwriting talent, "But One Day" shows tremendous growth for this already-established German diva. It's arguably her best album to date, and her most accessible. If you're interested in checking out the amazing Ute Lemper, this is a wonderful place to start. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002VCB March 9, 2003 7 7 4.0 A Musical Look At The Fairer Sex The Alan Parsons Project take a look at the female gender with their 1979 album, appropriately titled "Eve." Although not one of the group's more popular albums, it's a very strong Project album all the same. It's catchy, melodic, well-written by Alan Parsons & Eric Woolfson, with sharp musical performances all around, great orchestrations by Andrew Powell, and fine vocals by such singers as Lenny Zakatek and Chris Rainbow. And what Project album would be complete without an excellent instrumental or two? "Lucifer" is a classic piece (and it's still used on many TV sports programs to this day), and "Secret Garden" is bouncy & spacious.However, "Eve" has always been a controversial album, as some female listeners think that some of the songs are degrading to women. This is totally not true. Songs like "You Lie Down With Dogs," "I'd Rather Be A Man," and "Winding Me Up" are not about ALL women in general---goodness, no. The male character of these songs is only singing about *one particular woman* that he's had a personal falling out with, and that's all. Some may find it hard to believe, but men can get hurt in broken relationships, too, which is all these particular songs are saying.Furthermore, lest we forget, "Eve" contains a couple of positive songs sung by women: the self-powering "Don't Hold Back," and the lovely album-closer, "If I Could Change Your Mind." Clare Torry & Leslie Duncan, who both were featured on the classic Pink Floyd album, "Dark Side Of The Moon" (which Parsons engineered), sing these songs very nicely, and I highly doubt that they would've taken part if they thought the album was sexist in any way. Nevermind the silly controversy: "Eve" is a fine entry in the Alan Parsons Project's catalog. Definitely pick it up. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000007S5B January 7, 2003 13 15 5.0 The Best Of The Doors The Doors were--and are--one of rock's greatest bands, with a unique sound all of their own. Flamboyant frontman Jim Morrison may have been the face & image of the group, but these guys always worked together like a classy four-headed machine to produce some of rock's greatest music. Picking a favorite Doors album is hard---even the criticized "Soft Parade" album has got some terrific Doors gems on it. But 1968's "Waiting For The Sun" is my personal favorite from The Doors. It's a great Doors classic that sees the band masterfully walking the tightrope between the hard rockers and the softer ballads. For their third album, singer Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger & drummer John Densmore decided to go for an earthier, softer sound on some of the tracks, which lends this Doors album an extra kind of beauty. Even Jim Morrison himself sounds more down-to-earth on this album, as his vocals on the first two Doors albums were very echoey, making him sound like he was a disembodied spirit, or recording his vocals inside a cave. Not that there's anything wrong with that---I love "The Doors" & "Strange Days"--- but Jim sounded on those first two albums like he was always floating in the clouds above his three musical co-horts. But on "Waiting For The Sun," Jim's voice is warmer, not so echoey, and on definite equal footing in the mix with his bandmates, which is a plus.Great Doors songs are everywhere on "Waiting For The Sun"---the huge hit "Hello I Love You," the beautiful "Love Street," the bizarre "Not To Touch The Earth" (an extract from an even longer Doors composition, "The Return Of The Lizard King," found on the live "In Concert" CD), the haunting "My Wild Love," and other Doors classics like "The Unknown Soldier," "Spanish Caravan," and the terrific rocker, "Five To One." Say what you want about Jim Morrison's strange lyrics & poetry, but give the man some credit---this guy definitely had a way with words, AND he had a monster voice & presence to match. He was the quintessential rock singer, and he is greatly missed. Ray Manzarek can stroke the keyboards like no one else on Earth (and NO ONE plays the organ as brilliantly as he does). Robby Krieger is a mean guitarist, serving up some incredibly memorable licks, and John Densmore is one of rock's finest drummers, whether slamming his drumkit like a man posessed, or just kicking back with a steady beat. I suppose "Waiting For The Sun" is also my favorite Doors album because it captures the band right smack in the middle of their lifespan, with two albums behind them and three more to go, and with so much life left in them as a great musical force. They rocked all the way to the end, in fact, right up until Morrison took his leave of planet Earth. But "Waiting For The Sun" is, I think, the band's masterpiece. It's an amazing Doors album filled with variety, feeling, and tremendous power. Pick it up! :-) 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B00001ZULV October 19, 2002 3 3 4.0 Not ALL The Hits, But It'll Do As the title, "Turn It On Again: The Hits" suggests, this Genesis compilation simply represents the band's *hits* (well, most of them). This is not a "Best-Of" retrospective of the band's career, just the stuff that made it onto the singles charts, which explains why the lion's share of this album comes from the Phil Collins era, Peter Gabriel's era is only represented twice, and Ray Wilson only once. Still, as a longtime Genesis follower, I'm very pleased with this disc, as it represents a great time when these guys were a strong presence on the radio airwaves. If you're a Genesis fan, either diehard or just casual, then listening to this CD will be a nice stroll down memory lane.Most of the usual suspects are here: "Follow You Follow Me," "Abacab" (single version), "That's All," "Invisible Touch," "Tonight Tonight Tonight" (single version), "No Son Of Mine," and "I Can't Dance." Thankfully, Ray Wilson's brief time as the group's frontman is represented here by "Congo," which briefly charted in the UK (I'm glad that at least *one* track from the very-overlooked Genesis album, "Calling All Stations," will be heard by somebody). And Peter Gabriel's only "hits" with the band, "I Know What I Like" & "The Carpet Crawlers" (both charted in the UK), are also here. And speaking of "The Carpet Crawlers," this version is a remake, with Gabriel, Collins, and guitarist Steve Hackett briefly returning to the fold for a handsome 1999 reworking of this classic nugget from "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway" (though everybody in the band recorded their parts separately). Quite possibly the very last thing the band will ever record together, this '99 "Carpet Crawlers," like the original version, is a sheer beauty. The album is worth getting just for this one track alone. However, with only so much space to work with on a compact disc, several other chart singles by Genesis have been left off, such as "Ripples," "Your Own Special Way," "No Reply At All," "Man On The Corner," "Paperlate," and "Never A Time." Still, all things considered, "Turn It On Again: The Hits" is a very good representation of Genesis' most popular tunes. If you're a diehard fan who already owns the whole band's catalog, get this CD for the "Carpet Crawlers" remake, as it's totally worth it. And if you're simply a casual fan, well then, get it for the hits. Either way, it's a win-win purchase. :-) 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000024SQH August 24, 2005 3 3 4.0 Gary Brooker Flies High In 1979, two years after Procol Harum disbanded (until their reunion in 1991), singer/songwriter/pianist Gary Brooker released his first solo album, "No More Fear Of Flying." In short, if you love Procol Harum, then you'll love Gary solo, too. "No More Fear Of Flying" is an excellent album of top-notch, Harum-flavored piano pop/rock, spearheaded by Brooker's powerful voice and masterful playing on the keys. Great songs include the title track, the lovely "Say It Ain't So Joe" (written by Murray Head) and "Angelina," the catchy "Give Me Something To Remember You By" and "Get Up And Dance." There's also two bonus tracks to enjoy: the rare Brooker B-side "S.S. Blues" and the previously-unreleased fun of "Fat Cats." Gary Brooker's "No More Fear Of Flying" is a great disc. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B00006GF6Y September 12, 2002 3 3 4.0 Fabulous Re-Issue, But DON'T Throw Away Your Old Copy! It was not too long ago that I reviewed The Who's 1965 debut album, "The Who Sings My Generation" (as it's known in the U.S.), and I remarked on how this was the only Who album to not get a remaster treatment, thanks to longstanding legal disputes between the band & producer Shel Talmy. Well, it appears those pesky legal disputes have finally been resolved (thank God), and now, here we are at last with the VERY long-awaited remastered edition of The Who's debut disc, retitled simply "My Generation" as it was originally titled in the UK. This version has been not only remastered, but also remixed into stereo for the first time, and expands the album into *two* discs, chock full of rare Who songs & alternate versions of some of the familiar tunes, as well as improved artwork, very classy photos of the band from 1965, and very informative liner notes from producer Talmy & others close to the band at the time. Whew--how's THAT for a complete Who package? Quite simply, it's marvelous.With the new stereo remix, The Who (Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle & Keith Moon) sound bigger, cleaner, crisper, and LOUDER on this album than ever before, giving the listener the great sensation of being in the studio with The Who themselves as they create these rock classics---"My Generation," "The Kids Are Alright," "La-La-La Lies," "A Legal Matter," "Circles," and many more. Some of the extra material, like "Leaving Here," "Lubie (Come Back Home)," "Shout And Shimmy," etc., had already been released on the Who rarity compilations, "Who's Missing" & "Two's Missing" (both are now out of print, however). Still, these tracks are just as terrific, and they compliment the main album very well. I also greatly appreciate the extra version of "The Good's Gone" with the extended ending, as this has always been one of my favorite Who tracks, the acapella "Anytime You Want Me," and the great fun of "Instant Party Mixture," the one previously unreleased in-any-format Who song on the collection. It's a real hoot.However, I can only give this new version of "My Generation" 4 out of 5 stars. In putting together this remixed, remastered edition of the album, producer Shel Talmy made two noticable errors. First off, on "La La La Lies," Daltrey's vocals are briefly clipped off at the 1:18 mark. Actually, his vocals were already like that on the original version, but Townshend's overdubbed harmony vocals covered up the mistake. Not so on this version---Townshend gets clipped off, too. And on "Circles," John Entwistle's french horn has been mysteriously removed altogether. Very disappointing, indeed.Nonetheless, this new deluxe edition of The Who's "My Generation" is a Who fan's dream, and, as the liner notes suggest, play it LOUD! But I strongly suggest that you buy it as a *companion* version to the original version of the album, rather than replace it altogether. Save The Ox's french horn playing on "Circles"---DON'T throw out your old copy. :-) 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000005T6K July 31, 2002 1 1 4.0 The Genesis Of Genesis For the 1969 debut album by Genesis, "From Genesis To Revelation," producer Jonathan King insisted on adding horns & string arrangements to most of the band's songs. Nonetheless, I enjoy the album just fine. "From Genesis To Revelation" is a far cry from anything else the band have recorded since, but it's a very good Genesis album in it's own right, with some fine material. The best tunes on the album are the few that the band get to rock on *without* orchestral accompanyment: "In The Beginning," "The Serpent," and the bonus track, "That's Me," all terrific Genesis rockers. I also appreciate the melodies of "When The Sour Turns To Sweet," "The Conquerer," "In Limbo," the Bee Gees-esque "The Silent Sun" (the band's first attempt at a hit single), "In Limbo," and the brief-but-beautiful "A Place To Call My Own." Peter Gabriel's voice is always a pleasure to hear, Tony Banks gets in some really good piano-thumping & organ-playing throughout, Mike Rutherford & Anthony Phillips both contribute some very good acoustic & electric guitar work, and drummer John Silver, in his lone album with the band, may be dwarfed by Phil Collins' looming shadow, but he's good enough behind the drumkit, certainly for this material, anyway. "From Genesis To Revelation" isn't the band's masterpiece, but it's still a very good debut album. If you're a diehard Genesis fan like me, you can't go wrong with adding "From Genesis To Revelation" to your collection. :-) 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B00005OM4F July 13, 2002 2 3 5.0 Don't Ignore This Beautiful Garbage There aren't too many new or new-ish bands out there that I truly like---I mostly go for the veteran groups of the 60's & 70's. But of the crop of groups that came out during the 90's, two of them, in my opinion, really stood out proudly from the rest, both for their creativity & originality. One of them was Nirvana (who are sadly no more), and the other is this wonderful band, Garbage, fronted by sultry Scottish lass Shirley Manson. Shirley & her cohorts Butch Vig, Duke Erikson, and Steve Marker have created some truly incredible music since their 1996 debut disc. Their music is a glorious whirlpool of rock, dance, techno, & industrial, filled with lots of giddy noises, sound effects, and samples, with Manson's seductive voice spearheading the proceedings. There is no other band out there right now that is quite like them, and, with the unfortunate demise of Nirvana, I can't think of any other 90's band still active today that can still hold my interest. Garbage are it---they're that good.How disappointing then, that Garbage's third album, "beautifulgarbage," is not doing particularly well in the shops. This is a very appropriately titled album, another beautiful whirpool blend of pop, rock, and sounds from Shirley & the boys. This time, Garbage streamline their sound just a bit, going into new musical areas like 60's girlgroup torchsong ("Can't Cry These Tears") and bubblegum pop ("Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go)"), which are quite refreshing. However, the band still serve up their familiar, unique blend of industrial rock in gems like "Shut Your Mouth," "Silence Is Golden," "Breaking Up The Girl," and "Parade." And there's also a couple of gorgeous ballads in the form of "Cup Of Coffee" and the lovely album closer, "So Like A Rose," two of the finest songs the band have ever recorded.As "beautifulgarbage" clearly shows, Garbage are still a major musical force to be reckoned with in the rock world. I seriously hope the disappointing sales of this album haven't put them off. They're a great band, and I'm sure they'll be back again in the next couple of years. In the meantime, don't make the same mistake that the masses have: add this "beatifulgarbage" to your CD collection now. Rock on, Garbage! :-) 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000060K0Q May 4, 2002 14 17 4.0 Another Great Disc From Supertramp Judging by some of the other reviews, I guess there's just no pleasing some Supertramp fans unless their idol, ex-bandmember Roger Hodgson, returns to the group. Well guys, get over it, already. Roger's been out of the band since 1985, and, by his own admission, he isn't coming back. It's Rick Davies' group now, so just accept it! With all due respect to the very-gifted Hodgson, I think Supertramp are carrying on just fine, thank you very much, as evidenced by their strong past three albums since Hodgson's departure. And now, there is a fourth: "Slow Motion," Supertramp's first new album in five years. It's yet another excellent disc from this veteran British outfit, and, if you happen to like the band's jazzier leanings, chances are you'll enjoy this latest offering from Davies & company."Slow Motion" is appropriately titled---no all-out rockers on display here. Just some very cool, very hip jazz/pop in the laid-back, mid-tempo style. But longtime fans should still take heart---we're talking about Supertramp here! You still get the unique keyboard work & lead vocals of Rick Davies, the big, brassy saxophone of John Halliwell, and the firm, commanding backbeat of Bob Siebenberg. Backed up by no less then FIVE other musical cohorts, including Hodgson replacement Mark Hart, Bob Siebenberg's son Jesse Siebenberg on percussion, and the excellent bassist Cliff Hugo, this is a Supertramp band that simply cooks.While admittedly having a simpler feel to it than it's predecessor, 1997's brilliant "Some Things Never Change," "Slow Motion" still finds Supertramp making irresistible music that's miles ahead of the current radio fodder. The fine title track that opens the album instantly sets the mood for the songs that follow. "Little By Little" is wonderfully catchy---if radio wasn't so snooty these days to veteran bands, this could easily be a big comeback hit for the band. "Over You" is a lovely tune with a 50's swing to it (love the horn arrangement on it, too). "Tenth Avenue Breakdown," the longest track on the album (almost nine minutes), finds the group re-visiting the progressive-jazz groove of "Brother Where You Bound." It's a very powerful piece. Also worth mentioning is the charming "Bee In Your Bonnet," and the *other* excellent progressive-jazz workout, "Dead Man's Blues." But the other songs on the album are quite good, too, and they grow on you.I had no idea at ALL that Supertramp had a new studio album in the works, so "Slow Motion" comes as a very wonderful surprise for me. Even though it's more laid-back than the band's previous efforts, it's still a very enjoyable album that will still get your toes tappin' and your fingers snappin'. Rock on, Supertramp! (NOTE: Only available in the U.S. right now as an import. Hopefully, this will change at some point. Don't forget your U.S. fans, gentlemen! Thanks.) 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B00005NWMK December 10, 2001 9 11 5.0 The Return Of Classic Yes Any Yes purist who thinks the band lost it after 1977's "Going For The One" will be absolutely overjoyed with the band's latest release, "Magnification." This is easily the best Yes album in many, many years. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of this veteran Englsh band, and I've enjoyed most of the band's later albums very much, including "Tormato," "90125" & "Open Your Eyes," all excellent albums in my opinion. But "Magnification"....WOW. Any Yes fan who overlooks this album is missing out big time on a truly special work.Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Steve Howe & Alan White are without a keyboard wizard this time around, but, as evidenced on "Magnification," this has quite plainly given the band an excellent musical opportunity rather than a problem. Their solution: bring in a first-rate orchestra, expertly conducted & arranged by Larry Groupe. The orchestra compliments the band brilliantly, lifting the band's new material to dizzying heights, and strengthening the band's performance in the process. Jon Anderson's golden, angelic voice remains in pristine condition, Chris Squire delivers some of his best basslines in years, including, at long last, a marvelous lead vocal on "Can You Imagine." Steve Howe's exquisite guitar playing is brought to the forefront, while Alan White's expert drumming keeps the whole thing firmly anchored (Alan even displays a knack for piano-playing that I never knew he had before). The band's songwriting on "Magnification" is also their best in quite a while. The incredible title-track, the dreamy "Give Love Each Day," Squire's "Can You Imagine," "We Agree," and the instant-classic suite "In The Presence Of," to name but a few, show the Yes men thoroughly inspired from the first track to the last. And "Magnification" also *sounds* great. Co-produced by Yes & Tim Weidner, the album has a crisp, big production value to contain all the amazing Yes nuggets within.Still not convinced? Check this out: I have a friend named Dave who is one of those aforementioned Yes purists who thinks "Going For The One" was the last time Yes said anything important musically. I insisted to Dave that he give "Magnification" a listen, so I lent him the disc. His review of the album the next day: "Wow! This is the best Yes album that I've heard in a long, LONG time. I've definitely gotta get this one!" Nuff said. :-) 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B00000ILLV May 20, 2001 2 2 4.0 Still Racin'! By the time 1971 came around, The Association weren't having hits or selling very much records anymore, and key member Russ Giguere had recently departed, being replaced by Richard Thompson. But "Stop Your Motor," while not being the band's masterpiece, still showed that the band were still making great music together. "Bring Yourself Home," "Funny Kind Of Song," "Along The Way," and the band's improved re-recording of "It's Gotta Be Real" (originally from the film "Goodbye Columbus") are all classic Association tunes, and Terry Kirkman's "That's Racin'," a tongue-in-cheek country-western tale of auto racing, is a fun novelty song. After "Stop Your Motor," The Association had only one more album left to do (1972's "Waterbeds In Trinidad"), but musically, they were still racin'. :-) 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002JB3 March 14, 2001 3 3 5.0 Dance Into Phil's Light! "Dance Into The Light" is one of Phil Collins' most overlooked albums. It was released in 1996, during a time when Phil wasn't as popular as he was all throughout the 80's, and still three years off from his comeback with the "Tarzan" movie soundtrack. It's really too bad that not too many people checked out this disc upon it's release, because "Dance Into The Light" is one of Phil's best albums, and his finest solo work since 1981's "Face Value." Highlights include "Lorenzo," a brilliant tune with lyrics from a poem by Michaela Odone, the young boy who inspired the film "Lorenzo's Oil." Phil supplies a powerful music bed for this piece, complete with slammin' African drum beats & instrumentation, and heartful vocal delivery. "Just Another Story" is another work of genius, with it's atmospheric, late night stroll-down-the-street vibe, as Phil tells a gripping tale about some people's lives in the big city. It's a very memorable song. "Oughta Know By Now" SHOULD have been this album's secret weapon. With a great guitar hook, tight brass arrangement and powerful drumming and singing from Phil, this song has all the makings of a smash hit, and could've been the song that saved the album from commercial disappointment. And "No Matter Who" is a wonderfully light, breezy number that also could've been a surefire hit. "Dance Into The Light" is a terrific hidden gem from one of the hardest working men in the music biz, Phil Collins. Check it out! 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B0000508TB November 19, 2000 26 27 4.0 Excellent Genesis Box, But It Could've Been Outstanding If you're a diehard quintessential Genesis fan like me, then this second Genesis box set covering the Phil Collins era is a must-have. "Archive Vol.2" gives you the lion's share of Genesis B-sides, rare songs by the band that I, personally, had been collecting over the years on 45" vinyl. To hear them at last in their full stereophonic CD glory is simply awesome. Also included are some fabulous live cuts, and a fine 65-page booklet with great photos of the band.Many Genesis favorites of mine abound: "Feeding The Fire," "Inside And Out," "Naminanu," "It's Yourself"....GREAT stuff. And the live material included here? Simply breathtaking. The band's live versions of "Ripples" & "Entangled" are so beautiful they bring a tear to my eye, while the live renditions of "The Lady Lies" & "Duke's Travels" feature the band at their most rockin' best. However....as much as I'd love to give "Genesis Archives Vol. 2" a perfect score, I can't. The reason? It's an *incomplete* box set. It's an excellent 3-CD set, but think of how outstanding this Genesis box could've been if had only been a 4-CD set. That way, the band could've put *everything* on it. There's absolutely no excuse for leaving off "Me And Virgil," one of the band's very best songs. Also missing from the box set: "Match Of The Day," a live version of "Eleventh Earl Of Mar" that Tony Banks has always spoken very fondly of, the uncut, full-length studio versions of "Mama" & "It's Gonna Get Better" that were released together as a 12" single (though there is a live version of the latter song included here), and lastly, all eight B-sides from the "Calling All Stations" album with singer Ray Wilson, as well as live material from this period. All ignored.Still, there's no denying the wealth of material that "Genesis Archives Vol.2" DOES have, so it's definitely worth getting. Just keep in mind that this Genesis box set isn't the *complete* picture of the band's rare recordings. Oh well. With all due affection to the Peter Gabriel years, if you love the band's Phil Collins-era music as well (like I do), then definitely pick up "Archive Vol.2". 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B0009MAPUO July 5, 2005 10 14 5.0 One Of Rock's Greatest Concept Albums A double album *rock musical* version of H.G. Wells' sci-fi classic, "The War Of The Worlds"? Many people would laugh at such an idea. But in 1978, musician/songwriter/producer Jeff Wayne actually did it, and created one of rock's most supreme concept albums. Although the album has always been much more popular in Britain and other parts of Europe (even having a multi-year UK album-chart run rivaling Pink Floyd's "Dark Side Of The Moon"), it nonetheless has a strong cult following here in North America, myself proudly included. I first became aware of the "War Of The Worlds" album sometime in the late 80's, when I discovered that Justin Hayward, the lead singer for The Moody Blues (one of my all-time favorite bands) was singing on it. Curious, I picked up a vinyl copy of the album at a used record store, dropped the needle on Side One, and I was instantly hooked. I'd never heard anything like it before. The way the Martian-invasion narrative is brilliantly sustained from beginning to end, and, of course, Jeff Wayne's incredible music score that matches it. And, completing the "War Of The Worlds" package, there's the elaborate artwork that accompanies & illustrates the album---simply marvelous to look at. No question about it, "The War Of The Worlds" is quite an acheivement. Nearly three decades later after it's initial release, the album still sounds just as fresh & exciting now as it did back then. Besides the legendary, commanding voice of Richard Burton as the album's narrator, Jeff Wayne's stunning music rocks ("Horsell Common & The Heat Ray"), rouses ("Brave New World"), has incredible beauty ("Forever Autumn"), and, at turns, is effectively eerie ("The Red Weed"). The musicianship that Wayne has ensembled for the album is first-rate, from great singers like Justin Hayward, David Essex, Thin Lizzy's Phil Lynott & Julie Covington, to incredible musicians like Jo Partridge, Herbie Flowers, Chris Spedding, and Jeff Wayne himself. The album has amazing moods, atmospherics & sound effects, and the surprise twist at the album's end still gives me goosebumps to this day! There's no doubt in my mind that H.G. Wells himself would've been very happy indeed with this powerful musical treatment of his story. Although Jeff Wayne's "War Of The Worlds" has never been staged, I was very fortunately blessed to see a Laserium presentation of the album at the London Planetarium back in July of 1990. They presented the *whole* double album, complete with lasers, slides, & pyrotechnics. There was even an intermission after Side Two! It was a truly spellbinding show, and a great tribute to the album's timeless appeal. The point of mentioning it is that Jeff Wayne's "War Of The Worlds" succeeds not only as a rock album, but as a storytelling album that lends itself quite well to visual presentation. I can easily see a touring "rock concert" presentation of "War Of The Worlds" someday, complete with rock band & orchestra, singers, slides, lasers & pyrotechnics. Maybe Jeff Wayne could try to hook up with someone in the theater world and mount such a production? One can dream....In the meantime, buy the CD, and discover for yourself what all the fuss is about. Jeff Wayne's "War Of The Worlds" is truly a rock musical masterwork. (NOTE: This is a slightly-revised version of the review I wrote for "The War Of The Worlds" five years ago, as the old CD version is now out-of-print. But I stand by every word of it, 'cause I love this album. Thanks.) 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002UWE May 4, 2005 6 6 5.0 Listen To Talk Talk This outstanding British art-pop band, led by singer/songwriter Mark Hollis, released five studio albums between 1982 and 1991. "Natural History" is a Best-Of collection that covers the first four Talk Talk albums, and I can most certainly guarantee that if you enjoy this disc, you'll definitely want to seek out the band's whole catalog. They only had one Top 40 hit in the States, "It's My Life" (recently covered by No Doubt), but there's a lot more intelligent, sophisticated tunes where that classic song came from. Talk Talk made GREAT music, with a grace and power in the way they used keyboards and piano, the big thumping of the drums, the cleverness of the songwriting & arrangements, the way their music could instantly grab you and hold your attention, and, of course, the distinctive, rich voice of Mark Hollis. "Talk Talk," "Such A Shame," "It's My Life," "Life Is What You Make It," "Living In Another World," "Desire"....simply wonderful songs. Thanks to "Natural History," I'm an instant fan, and I'm already seeking out the rest of the group's stuff. They never got the huge success that they so rightfully deserved, but Talk Talk was and IS a band to treasure. "Natural History" is a marvelous introduction. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002R0P March 19, 2005 2 2 4.0 Interview With The Giant The eighth Gentle Giant album, 1976's "Interview," finds the art-rock band *just starting* to step away from their earlier progressive sound, and crafting tunes that were a bit looser and more accessible to the ears (the change in musical direction would be complete by the next album, "The Missing Piece"). But there's still enough of the ol' Gentle Giant sound here to satisfy the diehard GG followers, while the more streamlined, simpler elements the band incorporate on "Interview" actually sound quite refreshing (honestly, I don't mind it when bands try different approaches to their music, just so long as the end result is still genuinely good music!). The title song is punchy & fun, as GG put rock music interviewers firmly in their place, while "Give It Back" has a surprising reggae-ish swing to it in parts, but it works well. "Design" is the song that sounds the most like classic Gentle Giant, featuring the group's trademark, haunting vocal arrangements. "Empty City" sounds a lot like Jethro Tull (one of the bands GG are always compared to), but that's cool with me, and it's both a very beautiful & powerful number. And the album concludes with "I Lost My Head," an instant Gentle Giant classic that is both elegant AND rockin'. It's definitely my favorite song on the album. There are those GG purists out there who say that "Interview" is the band's last good album, as many of them did NOT warm up to the group's later work, starting with "The Missing Piece." I don't think the band nosedived after "Interview"---for starters, I happen to love "The Missing Piece" (but that's another review). "Interview" is an excellent Gentle Giant album, but it certainly isn't their "last" excellent album. There was still some great music yet to come from this Gentle ol' Giant. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU B000002VT6 February 2, 2005 5 8 4.0 Sarah Surfaces After the success of her breakthrough 1993 album, "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy," and the lengthy tour that followed it, Sarah McLachlan took a couple of years off from the music biz before resurfacing in a big, BIG way with 1997's "Surfacing," which became her biggest-selling album to date. Sarah's masterful blending of pop, rock, and folk continues to work it's magic on "Surfacing," on such Sarah classics as the soft rockers "Building A Mystery" and "Sweet Surrender," and the absolutely gorgeous songs "Adia," "Angel," and "Full Of Grace." And even though it wasn't released as a single, "Black & White," the most rhythmic, atmospheric piece on the album, is my personal favorite from "Surfacing." It's a tremendous song, the album's secret weapon. But ALL of the songs here are quite marvelous, and Sarah's heavenly voice is just as entrancing as ever. Although "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy" still stands as my favorite album from Sarah, "Surfacing" is a sparkling beauty. 
A10XJR7CWHNKWU 0345460952 December 21, 2004 10 10 5.0 Farewell, Douglas The world was robbed of one it's greatest and funniest writers on May 11, 2001, when Douglas Adams, author of the hugely popular "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" and "Dirk Gently" books, died from a heart attack at the age of 49. As a writer, Adams was a true original. His style of humor was gloriously funny, and he certainly had a most unique way with words. His final book, the posthumous release "The Salmon Of Doubt," is a collection of assorted writings, including essays, e-mails, interviews, lectures and letters that Adams had given or written over the years, as well as an unfinished third "Dirk Gently" novel that Adams had been sporadically working on for many years. Much of the material was culled from the disk drives of Adams' collection of Macintosh computers, and we, Adams' faithful readers, can certainly be grateful for these golden DNA nuggets. The book contains such gems as Adams discussing his childhood, his nose, his friendship with dogs Maggie and Trudie, his great introduction to Procol Harum (a favorite band of Adams AND myself) just before they take the stage, his advice about how to make a cup of really good tea, his attempts to get "Hitchhiker's" made as a feature film (which is *finally* happening in 2005), and his lecture about the existence of an artificial God. There's also a hilarious sketch about Genghis Khan, a short "Hitchhiker's" story involving Zaphod Beeblebrox, and, finally, 11 chapters of the unfinished Dirk Gently novel, entitled "The Salmon Of Doubt," which, although it is quite obviously an unpolished work-in-progress, is still very funny (though I'm saddened that we'll never know what happens to Dirk after Chapter 11, which is a terrible shame). Douglas Adams had so much more left to give to this world, he had so much more left to write. But we can take comfort in the great, hysterically funny gifts he did leave us---"Hitchhiker's" (not only the books but also the radio & TV series, and the upcoming feature film), "Dirk Gently," the travelogue book "Last Chance To See" (which succeeds as a serious piece sprinkled with great humor throughout), and his writing for the "Doctor Who" TV series. Douglas, as a longtime fan of yours, I just want to thank you for all the good cheer you've given me over the years. I will treasure your work & your memory 'til the end of my days, and perhaps even after that. "The Salmon Of Doubt" is a very fond farewell to the late, great Douglas Noel Adams. 
A10XJYJ0AHB3QY 0674843711 April 4, 2000 40 41 5.0 The network structure of social capital "The Network Structure of Social Capital" by RonaldBurt at the U Chicago Graduate School of Business is one paper thatheld my attention. "Social capital" is a metaphor for the accumulated wealth built up in a personal network; better connected people have more social capital, and as a result they gain advantages in social situations. Burt's thesis is that social capital depends on not just the size of your social network, but also its nature and structure. Here's a brief summary. If you're looking to get ahead, you should aim to build a circle of work and personal contacts that is broad and diverse. The more diverse your contacts, the more likely it is that you will find an opportunity through them. It's particularly important not to narrow your networking efforts to a single clique of all like-minded people who all know each other and don't mix much with others; maintaining such connections gets in the way of more productive efforts that bring in a steady mix of new faces. When you have a network that gives you the opportunity to connect two widely diverse parts of an enterprise together, or when you can bring friends together who know you but don't know each other, you stand in the role of _gaudius tertius_, "the third who benefits". Even if you don't explicitly control the relationship (now I don't want to sound too mercenary here; remember, this is social science, not Emily Post) you will still benefit from the control of and access to flow between two elements that have been insulated from each other. The pieces of an organization's or a population's network that don't communicate much are insulated by what Burt calls "Structural Holes" (the title of one of his books). He goes into detail studying behavior and networks of senior managers in an organization trying to find structural holes and predicting with a fair degree of accuracy who will get ahead in the corporate game by how big people's networks are (bigger is better), how centered their networks are on their bosses (all things equal, you'd rather know people who your boss doesn't -- but take advantage of your boss's network to bootstrap your own) and the overlaps in their contacts networks (be the bridge between people who don't know each other). A good read, if you're into theory, though a bit of a slog at times. The author appears to bear a bit of a grudge against some fellow academics who disagree with his conclusions - those academics went off and formed a little clique that's busy quoting each other and recommending that senior managers build little cliques within their own companies. I believe that eclectic networks bring the best results persuasion by my nature. (Witness Vacuum.) [From Vacuum #11. http://vacuum.mi.org] END

A10XU1ERL5JPV8 B000002VCO January 12, 2005 2 2 4.0 The Alan Parsons Project turn to pop Well, it started happening with 'Eye in the Sky' but with this album the Project complete the approach to pop, which will go further on 'Vulture Culture' and will turn again into a more rocky, aggressive sound on 'Stereotomy'. The opening is a great song, 'Prime Time' certainly similar to 'Eye in the Sky' but not so sentimental and more intense and emotional tho. 'Let Me go Home' is the classic "angry" Project song with Lenny Zakatek on vocals, this one better than some others in my opinion. 'One Good Reson' is a little funny song with a lot of Beatles flavour, and with Ian Bairnsons' guitar sounding a lot like George Harrison's. 'Since the Last Goodbye' is also a very lennonian composition, a wonderful ballad which has been sadly and unfairly underrated and ignored for the beauty of its complicated sequence of chords and of Chris Rainbow's vocals. 'Don't Answer Me' is a simple but beautiful ballad, but more obvious, with a beautiful movie/cartoon video. The second side is almost as interesting as the first one. Opens with a strange and nice song called 'Dancing on a High Wire' sung by Colin Blunstone, who used to sing softer songs and ballads before this one. The nex one is the most disposable track, 'You Don't Believe' although the song was used for the first 'the best of' before the album was released. 'Pipeline' is a small instrumental gem with nice orchestration, minimalistic guitar and a certain Spanish feel. And the last son, 'Ammonia Avenue', probably the strongest track in the album, is a Project classic, a more than beautiful ballad nice sung by Eric Woolfson with a terrifying instrumental part in the middle. The album is not a masterpiece, but a good step forward since 'Eye in the Sky'. The structure of the album reminds reasonably to Dire Straits 'Brothers in Arms' being only 2 years ahead, and with a very accurate and varied group of 5 songs in side A, some weaker songs in side B and a big climax at the end with an epic ballad. Recommended for everybody. 
A10XU1ERL5JPV8 B00000AF3L June 13, 2004 0 0 5.0 Delicious Maybe the best Nightnoise work along with 'Parting Tide' and 'At the End of the Evening', this is a highly evocative collection of moody and reflective Celtic, instrumental themes full of subtleness, technical quality and high spiritual pretentions, resulting in the sweetest and most magical soft music you've ever heard. The opener 'Timewinds' is a very uplifting tune in the very mood of Mike Oldfield, if leaded by superb fiddle by Billy Oskay, sadly out of the band now. 'Perchance to Dream' is one of the softest and purest melodies you'll ever hear and grey and misty 'Hourglass' recalls the passing of time in a little Irish country village, with a sense of joy and hope at the end. 'Tundra Summer' sounds ominous and transcendental and 'I Still Remember' sounds adventurous and full of feeling. 'Something of Time' is maybe second to 'The Parting Tide' in bringing subtle and extremely beautiful sounds to your ears. Still a very deep work but not as much as 'At the End of The Evening'. Maybe that's its good thing, the balance between deepness and objective quality. It is a piece of art indicated for romantics and smooth instrumental likers. 
A10XU1ERL5JPV8 B000007R1M November 12, 2003 1 8 3.0 Weird sound called techno They say this is the first `techno' album ever... who knows. It sounds really weird even now, and it was made in the seventies. Personally my favourite is `The Model'... it's almost... commercial... They say these guys used to compose the same number of notes everyday... It's interesting. `Spacelab' is a cute and nice song. If you listen to this you will feel catatonic-elektronik-psykodelik-grooveytronik-... This is the stone age of techno. 
A10XU1ERL5JPV8 B00000I40A September 14, 2003 2 2 4.0 'Green Into Gold' is a real musical wonder I bought this record as an L.P. on 1989 and still have heard few instrumental songs as beautiful as the third cut 'Green Into Gold'. Surrounded by a very mysterious atmosphere of percussions and other sounds, a piano plays a very repetitive riff while the mean melody on the right hand developes to a beautiful chorus. This is a very in crescendo song and in some minutes you get into a glorious musical environment full of beauty and feeling... the song lasts up to more than ten minutes until the song fades away. The rest of the work is impressive as a very fine new age work. The opening track is a tribute to Bartolomeo Cristofori, the man that's considered as the inventor of the piano. The second track is a beautiful and highly romantic track called 'Spiral Dance'. The second side is less significative although there are still nice tracks on it. 'Wings to Altair' holds a very ceremonial feel. 'Summer's Child' is nice and 'Free Fall' reminds me to some songs from Wayne Gratz's 'Reminiscence'. The last song is a fine tribute of Procol Harum's 60's hit 'A Whiter Shade of Pale', with the same organ player playing again. I don't know the last track, 'Madre de la Tierra' because I have the original release. But might be a very beautiful song, according to the title in Spanish (Mother of the Earth). 
A10XU1ERL5JPV8 B00000JT35 January 27, 2002 4 4 4.0 East and West music, beautifully entwined In the vein of other Eastern authors, like say Kitaro, Hiroshima, Azuma, Ryuichi Sakamoto and many others, Naoyuki tries to build a link between the modern jazz/pop/rock from the West and the traditional Eastern sources. The result is a very romantic and sensitive collection of smooth songs, from the monotony and predictability of some tracks to the sublime beauty of some like 'Heartland' or 'Dreams'. In general its an enjoyable recording and has a couple of unforgettable tracks for the romantics. 'The Night Sky' is an unfortunate seeking of a smooth jazz/Eastern traditional mix. But the two titles mentioned above are brilliant and extremely beautiful, and 'Distant Vista' is a very honest and intense tune. A fine record to give it a try. 
A10Y3OZWENAQ6W 0786889284 February 9, 2006 0 0 4.0 Very Interesting I rate this crime book an A-. The story was interesting as well as the investigation techiques presented. I didn't bond with the lead investigators. I did feel sympathy for some of the characters. Three women are killed in arson fires that burn so hot that very little is left. Meanwhile, there is a boy who lives with an abusive stepfather. The boy has a relationship with a kind pyschic .The boy's story and the fires come together. For its lenght, this book is a quick read. This novel however, could have been edited more.This was my first Ridley Pearson novel and I would read him again. 
A10Y3OZWENAQ6W 0316734942 October 25, 2005 1 1 4.0 One of the Best of Bosch I have read and/or listened to almost every Harry Bosch novel.The Closers is one of the best of this series. This story is much more character driven than plot driven. I liked the people in the story very much. I will say that police work was very interesting. It's a good weekend read. 
A10Y3OZWENAQ6W 0446531855 July 2, 2005 0 3 3.0 It Kept Me Awake This novel had a lots of twists and was unpredictible. I looked forward to reading each night. I felt sadness for some of the characters in the story which is a compliment to the author James Siegel. I recommend this book. 
A10Y3OZWENAQ6W 1573222410 January 8, 2004 1 2 3.0 Nuala's Long Journey This is the first book by Nuala Faolain that I read so I don't have anything to compare it with. I am also a middle aged woman so many of the statements she made hit me right in the chest. I could feel her pain. Although I related to her story, I found the book tedious at times. I would not recommend this book for everyone. I don't believe that women in their twenties or thirties would fully appreciate Naula's story. 
A10Y596I3SL84S 0783116780 December 14, 2001 12 14 3.0 Poor poor Larry I've seen Larry Holmes interviewed in the past and at first I thought he was just a man with a massive inferiority complex but now I understand his problem. When a film such as this (which gives a fairly detailed history of the heavyweight crown) completely and uterly ignores his domination of the division for a five to eight year span, I think his complex is justified. Max Baer and Primo Carnera get five times as much attention in this movie as does holmes. I was also expecting some kind of explanation of when and how the multiple governing bodies took precedence in the awarding of the title. After all it's something that could be discussed in narration alone without additional footage. Instead... we magically skip from Ali, who apparently has one title, to the days of Tyson and multiple titles. This is an important omition. I understand that there is not film coverage of the absolute beginning of the heavyweight crown but I also find fault with the omission of this info... 
A10Y596I3SL84S 6305438218 March 31, 2000 3 8 1.0 Thank God! Thank God Terrence Malick only makes one film every fifteen years. This laughable movie and all of its unsubstantiated praise makes me sick. The phrase "character chewing" is the one I've used most often to describe the direction of this movie. Who were the characters again? What did they want? Why are we supposed to care when the guys wife leaves him? The reason I typically don't review films I think are bad is because I lose sight of reason when I think about them. I cannot begin to explain how slow moving and unimportant this film is. 
A10Y8FHZU6B2X1 1592401279 August 14, 2005 4 4 5.0 Make this story a bestseller! How we will ultimately exit Iraq! This story is a must read for all Americans, especially those vocal, confused protestors who believe that we can just "pull out." We are doing important and often frustrating work to rebuild a nation in the face of an armed insurgency. All of us: American, the Iraqis, and the rest of the world are frustrated at the pace of progress. This story takes you to the frontlines of this operation and exposes the reader to a slice of what is good and bad about our efforts to rebuild Iraq, and why progress is so frustratingly slow. The President and our troops need all of our support to acomplish this mission. As Rob points out in his summary, we need more "boots on the ground," not less. We need to provide real security for ourselves, the Iraqi population, and the contractors who are rebuilding Iraq's infrstructure. We need more men and women working directly with Iraq's civil government to improve living conditions and the economy. Once security is achieved, many humanitarian organizations will come into Iraq and help. Until then, it all falls upon the shoulders of the Civil Affairs teams. Every American should ask, "How can I help these brave men and women better achieve their mission?" Only through their success will we be able to bring our troops home. 
A10Y8FHZU6B2X1 0787938882 June 6, 2000 11 11 5.0 Very Helpful - Well Organized and Thoughtful There are a lot of books about facilitation skills and techniques. This is one of the best because it is well organized and thoughtful in its presentation. It is very theoretical and does help an exerienced facilitator zero in on areas to improve, but is also useful to the beginner by providing a good framework to work from. The key to success (like so many things) is practice. This is a good guide to get you started on the right foot and to use as a reference over time as your facilitation skills develop. 
A10YEV1HMQRO7M 0789478293 November 29, 2001 15 15 5.0 Even better than Walking With Dinosaurs As a writer who specializes in novels about prehistoric life forms continuing to exist into the present, this book is an invaluable reference. For anybody interested in prehistoric life, this beautiful book presents artistic and extremely life-like images of the extinct fauna that came to populate the planet following the dinosaurs. So much so, that you will believe you are seeing them in the flesh. I was especially pleased by the terror birds and the evolution of the prehistoric whales. 
A10YR68JAOWZH8 1842402056 June 21, 2003 5 5 1.0 Trivial trivia Few would argue that the Beatles are the most well-documented and critiqued act in entertainment. Admist a vast sea of literature, there are bound to be books that don't necessarily give those who are casually interested in the Beatles or those who are avid fans the best and most interesting source of information. This book is one of those examples. To the casual fan, the book will mean nothing since it does not serve as an introduction to the group's history. More notably, to the more serious fan, the book presents nothing new -- these "myths" have been known and understood for years. For example, it's safe to say that a handful of them stemmed from Philip Norman's "Shout" and Nicholas Schaffner's "The Beatles Forever" - two far more superior books, but not without their flaws and questionable interpretations. If you are an avid fan or a more serious Beatle "scholar", you may want to skim through this book as I did and see the humor in it. Then, toss it in the pile of other trivial Beatle books to recycle. If you are a casual fan and want more of an introduction to the greatest rock act of all time (including all the "mythology"), you are better off investing your hard-earned money elsewhere. 
A10YTF4AWR5XCD B00008NGHA May 18, 2003 4 4 4.0 Experience the Alternative - WOW! X 2003 is loaded...heavily loaded. This is your CD is you feel a need to rock out! Wow! Packed from beginning to end of this two CD set are songs from some of today's best Christian alternative/rock bands. There are some new bands listed on here as well and this CD I'm sure will help get their name out there. There are many times during the year that Christian stores will offer the "Simply Familiar" "Simply Christian" rock and pop music samplers at "Simply Irresistible" prices that "Simply Get Forgotten" a lot of times. (I "simply" don't understand the "simply" tag on that promotion) The main purpose of these is to expose the new artists and promote new albums by familiar artists. X 2003 is put together by a collaboration between Tooth & Nail, Forefront and Sparrow Records and may be the best collection of Christian alt/rock music put together yet. Disc One leads off with the appropriate "Get This Party Started" from Tobymac. It really sets the mood for the rest of the collection, despite the editing blunder that abruptly cuts the song off in the middle of a word! Not a sentence, but a word, just seconds from the actual ending of the song. Pillar takes off next with their big hit "Fireproof" from their album of the same name. Disc one continues with songs from established bands like the OC Supertones, Mxpx, Bleach and Five Iron Frenzy. There are a few new bands introduced to the listener as well, such as Justifide, Sanctus Real and Holland. Switchfoot is represented by their track "You Already Take Me There" which is a somewhat bizarre choice since they do have a newer album out with other songs that would have made excellent choice to be on this disc. As bonus tracks we hear from new bands Anberlin and Watashi Wa. Relient K starts off disc two with "Chap Stick, Chapped Lips and Things Like Chemistry" and then Audio Adrenaline keeps things going with "Summertime". Again, another bizarre choice because of the fact AA has a newer release that could be featured, but regardless, the song fits really well with the energy of this collection. Disc two is my favorite of the two discs because there are some awesome rock tracks on here. "Your Touch" from Kutless, "John Woo" off of the Newsboys "Thrive" CD which is a great release from them. Further Seems Forever is a new band with a very unique electronic-style rock sound, that at times is rather "experimental", and lend their song "The Sound" to this CD. There is some youthful rap-rock offered from PAX 217's "Engage" and some hip-hop from The Cross Movement and Peace of Mind which features KJ-52 on vocals. Jeremy Camp lends his song of surrender to the party with "Take My Life" and is appropriately followed up by his fiance's band The Benjamin Gate's "Lift Me Up". Disc two also features Tait, Tree 63, Delirious?, Skillet and Demon Hunter. The bonus tracks are from Lucerin Blue and Starflyer 59. This set is a great sampler of the Christian music that is out there from these record labels, and is definitely something Christian youth can enjoy and listen to with friends who may not be Christian. This is for the listener who enjoys the heavier rock style and wouldn't last one minute with the radio dial on K-LOVE. You get 34 songs in this collection that are up-tempo, energetic, and simply RAWK! 4 of 5 stars 
A10YV4ES6MAS89 B00004RALQ December 5, 2001 9 9 5.0 gotta love this grill This is a quality grill. It arrived in perfect condition, and we put it together with minimal effort. The parts are sturdy and well-fitting. Several thoughtful little details (such as the flip-up panel on the grill that allows you to add more charcoal) make things easy for BBQ beginners like my husband and I. The catch bin at the bottom is simple to use, prevents ash from blowing all over the yard, and you can make several dinners on the grill before needing to empty the bin. A chimney starter accessory is a must. No more lighter fluid, no more endless waiting for the coals to get hot enough to start cooking. It makes the difference between a barbequed meal being an hours-long production and a casual "Hey, why don't we barbeque that?" just before dinnertime. 
A10ZBQOYCVRFMU 6300230066 February 15, 1999 2 5 5.0 Tit-tit-tittilating! This movie gets five stars for pure awfulness! "Based on the novel by Ed Wood," (did he direct this under a pseudonym...?) a bunch of "damned" (and mostly damned chunky) chicks are raised from the dead by a guy in a REALLY cheap vampire suit and forced to dance (in various stages of undress) for his jovially demonic pleasure. With a plot about on par with the average "Tales From the Crypt" episode (and with even more frontal nudity), you can just let your brain go out for a beer while you watch this one! My (and my wife's) personal favorite: the porky "indian princess" in red thong undies! Dig those tom-toms! I'm sure all the women who were in this (if they haven't killed themselves from shame), are somewhere thinking "I can't BELIEVE I slept with Ed Wood to get this part!" I'm especially amused that the only other review of this movie is by some OTHER poor bastard in Akron, Ohio. Plainly this IS the cultural center of the universe! 
A10ZBQOYCVRFMU 6304039565 January 16, 1999 2 2 5.0 A must-see that is, sadly, virtually unknown! During the Vietnam war, an abandoned castle in the Pacific Northwest becomes the site of a highly experimental mental hospital for shell-shocked soldiers (who may be faking). Psychiatrist Colonel Kane (Keach), arrives to take over and begins to earn the grudging trust of the patients, especially Capt. Billy Cutshaw (Scott Wilson). Thing is, Kane's got issues of his own... This is a brilliant movie which manages to combine humor, violence, madness and theological angst with a what-the-hell-was-that pace that will put blisters on your eyeballs. Unfortunately, for some reason, this film is virtually unknown. If not for the wonder of cable TV, I'd've missed it myself, but now it's one of my all-time favorites. In short, SEE THIS MOVIE! NOW! 
A10ZFE6YE0UHW8 0974764507 July 31, 2004 15 15 5.0 A fascinating look at the mind-brain paradox This book confronts one of life's most personal and fascinating paradoxes. Science shows us that the brain is a heap of very fancy chemistry. Yet through consciousness and feelings we experience something more. The book starts with an exhaustive inventory of traditional and religious thought on the subject over thousands of years. You may want to skim this section. McGraw then summarizes in 150 pages what modern science has discovered about the workings of the brain. The third section shows how and why we naturally cling to spiritual beliefs and offers a conclusion. A great read for anyone interested in science vs. religion or the mind-brain conundrum. 
A10ZG0QKITDBW1 0525944478 June 2, 1999 18 18 5.0 Most Excellent Book ! You won't be sorry you bought it ! Dr.Taylor puts forth an informative, intelligent and easy to read book on this controversial subject. He does not bore us with all the "new age jargon" or "arrogant ramblings" that most authors do on Astral Travel. He is straightforward, honest, and "down to earth" (no pun intended). I found his experiences have helped me immensely in my own quest to soul travel. His background as a NASA Engineer only gives more validity to his writings. If you want a book that is complicated, overly technical, and slathering in arrogance this is NOT the one. If you want a book that is easily understood, interesting, excellently written, with a little humor, THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BOOK. I read this book in one sitting. Excellent Job Dr. Taylor! 
A10ZQL4FRSGYO4 0805241183 April 2, 1998 3 3 5.0 Compliments, rather than replaces, earlier editions. This new edition is useful in that it makes some parts of the narrative closer to the original. In other parts, thoughit seems to muddle things. Its hard to acsertain which is better, this is a complex issue which always comes into play when a complex author is translated into another language. I would suggest that people read both editions together, as this novel is rich enough to be rewarding each time. 
A10ZSSZO3BO11Z B00065JTB0 March 23, 2005 5 6 5.0 What [...] is wrong with ya'll? [...] Do ya'll have ears? This is a great debut album. It mixes pop, rock and trance together. The mix of this album is awesome. First- 8/10 great album opener. Nobody 'Til You- 8/10 love the music. Symptoms of You- 7/10 the chorus isn't that great. Speak- 10/10 3rd single awesome song.

Anything But Me- 9/10 pop mixed with rock. Disconnected- 9/10 another great slow song. To Know Your Name- 10/10 definetly my favorite song on the album.

Great song. This album to me is perfect. Most of my favorite types of music are on this album. Overall rating 9.5 
A10ZSSZO3BO11Z B00064AM62 December 28, 2004 4 6 5.0 GREAT Package This is a great collection from britney. It shows stuff I've never seen before. I didn't even know that there was a regular version of the overprotective video. I thought she just had a remix version. I finally got to see the full version of th I Love Rock N Roll video. I saw parts of it before but never saw the whole thing. I never saw the Born To Make You Happy video either but I knew she had one for the song. This is worth buying. It tops all of her other DVD's. Her last DVD sucked. And the one before that did too. 
A10ZSSZO3BO11Z B00006879E June 29, 2004 1 4 5.0 I'm tangled with this cd....and I don't hate it!!!! This cd is great. At first when i bought it i didn't listen to it that much. Now i realize that was a dumb mistake cuz it is a great cd. 1. Harder To Breathe 10/10 (1st single) 2. This Love 10/10 (2nd single) 3. Shiver 10/10 4.

A10ZSSZO3BO11Z B0000CAQ27 November 17, 2003 0 2 5.0 Want Trouble?...Try Th!s This is P!nk's best album....She totally blew me away. I wasnt sure if i should get it at first but then i did and it just takes you away. I listened through it the first time and i loved it. Trouble,God Is A Dj, Last To Know, Humble Neighborhood, and Waiting For Love are my favorites. I was listening through 'waiting for love' and i was about to skip it. And just i was about to, the chorus came on and i was like whoa.....She was singing like a f*cking singer.....Her voice is so awesome. So Waiting For Love is my fave...The dvd is good to. I recomend this cd very much to anyone!!!!!!!!!!! 
A11046XQ40ND5H B00004SPDH April 14, 2003 13 14 4.0 Effective Product; Not as hard to use as some here say After reading the negative comments about this machine, I was worried: should I have bought it? Did I waste my money? Now that it's arrived, I found it very easy to use. I sucessfully made spaghetti and fettucine my first try, although I threw it out per the instructions, because this was the very first time I used it and this runthrough cleaned the manufacturing residue out of the machine. Here are my tips: 1. Make sure your pasta dough is well kneaded until it is smooth. Let it rest covered in plastic wrap at least 20 minutes. 2. Cut your dough into pieces. If you're making 1lb of pasta (about 2 cups flour, 2 eggs in most recipes,) cut the dough into four pieces. 3. With rolling pin, roll each piece into a rectangle. Make sure it is not too thick. Very lightly dust with flour if necessary. I rolled mine to about twice the thickness of the widest setting on the rollers. If the end of the rectangle is too narrow, cut a bit off to square it up somewhat. 4. Let the dough rest another 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap. 5. Very lightly dust the first piece with flour, both sides. Run it through the machine slowly. If the dough feels very smooth and dry, flouring doesn't seem to be necessary. If your rectangle is too thick, the machine will pull some through while most of it bunches up on the rollers. This will cause your rectangle to tear and form holes as it passes through the rollers. 6. When it comes out, fold it in half (take the back end that just came out of the machine, fold it up to meet the front end.) Run it through the machine again. Do this at least six times. Very lightly dust with flour as necessary. The dough should be very smooth by now. 7. Turn the dial in one setting. Run the pasta sheet through. Make sure the piece goes in square so that it's not running to one side of the rollers, otherwise it may bunch and tear. If it is pulling towards one side, you can guide it with your free hand to the other. Don't worry about the dough folding on itself as it comes out. It seems very resiliant. I had no problems doing this by myself. 8. Repeat step seven until you run the piece through at the narrowest setting. 9. Repeat with the rest of your dough. Let the dough rest a bit, then run the first piece through the cutter attachment of your choice. As the pieces coming out get to the length you want, very lightly cut the rectangle of dough just before it enters the cutter rollers. Use a very sharp paring knife. I tried cutting the pasta as it was coming out, but that was awkward. The sheet of pasta you're working on now needs to be put back into the cutter rollers (because you've just cut it loose. ) 10. Repeat with the other pieces of rolled pasta. I did one practice run with some dough to clean out the machine, as per the instructions. This was my practice run. The very first runthrough was not successful, and then I hit upon the idea of rolling the dough into a rectangle as in step 3 above. Then I hit upon the idea of using smaller pieces of dough to prevent getting unmangeably long sheets. I would give this machine five stars if it were stainless steel, and washable. 
A110AP71Q2CS1R B00006LI3R November 12, 2002 6 7 4.0 An odd Boston album--odd but good. To say this is an odd album doesn't quite fully describe it. So I'll try to fully describe it! This album has three faces. Not including the live version of "Livin' For You", five of the album's nine songs were written or co-written by the band's founder/main songwriter/guitarist/producer Tom Scholz, three songs were written by Anthony Cosmo, son of Boston vocalist Fran Cosmo, and one song was written by Boston's new vocalist Kimberly Dahme. That's the songwriting credits. The lead vocals are divided among original Boston singer Brad Delp, the lead singer from Boston's 1994 album Walk On (Fran Cosmo) and the newest Boston vocalist, Kimberly Dahme. A break down of the songs on Corporate America: 1. "I Had A Good Time" (written by Tom Scholz) - One of the best tracks on this album, "I Had A Good Time" would've fit perfectly onto Boston's 1986 album Third Stage and, in fact, has many similarities to some songs off of Third Stage (most notably "I Think I Like It" and "We're Ready"). Brad Delp provides the vocals on this one. This song easily ranks among Boston's better songs. No, it isn't "More Than A Feeling" but it's on par with many of the best "second tier" Boston songs like the aforementioned "We're Ready" and "I Think I Like It". I rate this song a nine out of ten. 2. "Stare Out Your Window" (written by Anthony Cosmo) - An upbeat song, the first of the Cosmo penned tunes is a pretty good song. It certainly doesn't have a Boston sound to it, but it's a good song nonetheless. Fran Cosmo provides the vocals. The song ranks an eight. 3. "Corporate America" (Tom Scholz) - If you're familiar with the new tracks from Boston's Greatest Hits album ("Higher Power" and "Tell Me"), then you already have an idea of what this track sounds like. In fact, this osng is basically a combination of "Tell Me" and "Higher Power". And though I find the lyrics to be disturbingly and distressingly anti-corporate America, I can look past the radical leftist lyrics and hear a great song. This song ranks a solid nine. 4. "With You" (Kimberly Dahme) - Dahme sings this folksy pop ballad and though it is a big departure for Boston, this song is very good. It easily ranks a nine. 5. "Someone" (Tom Scholz) - Even though it's Brad Delp singing lead here, this song would have been right at home on 1994's Walk On (it kinda reminds me of "I Need Your Love"). Like every track on Walk On, this is a very good song. I'll give it a nine out of ten. 6. "Turn It Off" (Anthony Cosmo) - Of the three Anthony Cosmo penned tracks (all of which are sung by Fran Cosmo), this is the only one that sounds like past Boston (think Walk On). Not only that but this epic, high-octane song just may be the best one on the album. It's close to perfect--it's a ten. 7. "Cryin'" (Anthony Cosmo) - This song doesn't do much for me. "Cryin'" is a decent ballad but it's merely a third tier Boston song. Fran Cosmo provides the vocals. It rates a seven. 8. "Didn't Mean To Fall In Love" (Tom Scholz/Curly Smith/Janet Minke) - This is another excellent song. Brad Delp sings lead vocals here as the song combines various aspects of Third Stage and Walk On. I'll give it a nine. 9. "You Gave Up On Love" (Tom Scholz) - Kimberly Dahme sings the vocals with two male vocalists (oddly enough, they aren't Cosmo and Delp). This song fits the style prevalent throughout Third Stage. And it may be the best track on the disc. Does it crack the Boston elite ("Foreplay/Long Time", "More Than A Feeling", "Peace of Mind", and "Don't Look Back")? Not quite, but it ranks among Boston's best songs. It's a ten. Track ten is a live version of "Livin' For You" with Fran Cosmo on vocals. "Livin' For You" is my least favorite tune off of Walk On. But it's still a good tune, live or not. It's a nine. I love this CD as strange as it is. That being said, it just may be my least favorite Boston album. However, Boston has never released a bad album. This album with definitely please those of you who loved Third Stage and Walk On. But for those Boston fans who weren't too thrilled with Third Stage or Walk On, this may not be a good disc for you to pick up. Final note: I wish Tom Scholz had co-written a couple of songs with Anthony Cosmo and/or Kimberly Dahme. I like what Cosmo and Dahme bring to the band. A collaboration or two with Scholz may have produced some stunning results. 
A110AP71Q2CS1R 0441182003 May 25, 2000 3 3 4.0 Vlad Taltos: One Very Unique Fantasy "Hero" The thing I most like about Vlad Taltos (the "star" of Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos series) is that he is Mr. Sarcasm. He's surrounded by all these mighty warlords and sorcerers and noblemen yet he does not fear pissing them off with his sarcastic wit and disrespectful comments. It's funny as heck! Vlad Taltos is an assassin and a minor mob boss in this novel. There are eight Vlad Taltos novels in all and this one (Taltos) is the best one to start with (even though it was the fourth written). Good book -- it turns your typical epic fantasy on it's ear. Vlad is hired to steal (he isn't a thief, he's an assassin!) an object for an "honorable" warlord and a vampire-sorceress. Somehow, this leads to Vlad taking a trip to the realm of the dead. All in a day's work, I guess. Good novel. I really enjoy Steven's Brust's work and I think Vlad Taltos is a most unique fantasy "hero". 
A110AP71Q2CS1R B00000B47N May 9, 2000 2 3 4.0 Actual Fantasy: Heavy Pink Floyd? Yes, Ayreon's second album, Actual Fantasy, can accurately be described as "heavy Pink Floyd". It's a good album, very atmospheric and symphonic. Arjen Anthony Lucassen (the man behind Ayreon) uses three different lead vocalists on the album -- sometimes in the same song. All three singers are very good and, when you couple this with the catchy vocal melodies, the result is powerful, sometimes bombastic, sometimes mellow, Floyd-like symphonic progressive hard rock. Enough adjectives for you? That's what happens when a band is hard to describe because they are so unique. This is Ayreon. It should be stressed that Mr. Lucassen is a good songwriter and never sacrifices the song in favor of technical self-indulgence. I dare say that if you like Pink Floyd and heavier rock, you will love this album. I certainly did and I'm not even a big Pink Floyd fan! 
A110AP71Q2CS1R B000001EMN March 24, 2000 0 5 2.0 Slang: A Sell-Out Album (Metallica Fans Take Note) Def Leppard created a style all their own in the '80s -- a style copied by many bands but Def Leppard did it best. They combined the heavy distorted guitar sound of '70s glam rock bands such as Mott the Hoople and T.Rex and fused that sound with elements of Led Zeppelin (pounding drums and bass) and Queen (catchy vocal melodies). But in 1996, after pop metal had fallen out of popularity, Def Leppard made Slang. Slang copies every succesful grunge and alternative band of the '90s. Slang does succeed here and there but it ain't Def Leppard at their best. People accuse Metallica of selling-out (a term that is over-used) but if Metallica had really sold-out, wouldn't they have gone grunge or alternative? Metallica did not sell-out. Def Leppard attempted to sell-out on Slang. Slang is a true sell-out album, not Metallica's recent stuff. But it ain't all bad -- there is a good song or two to be found on Slang. It just isn't Def Leppard at their best. 
A110AP71Q2CS1R 0345412966 January 4, 2000 0 0 4.0 The Ringworld Dethroned? The Ringworld Throne starts off good enough but the later third of the novel seems to lose it's way. It is still a good read but could have been better with a bit more cohesion at the end, it becomes too complicated. I still give it 4 stars because the first two-thirds of the novel is very good but, to be honest, I almost gave this book 3 stars because the story just didn't pay off. 
A110AP71Q2CS1R B0000659Y3 June 12, 2002 1 1 5.0 Zodiac: One of my All-Time Favorites! Zodiac is a concept album that has one song for each of the twelve signs of the zodiac. Every song has its moments, but my favorites include the powerful and aggressive "Aries", the sprawling epic "Libra" (it's only four minutes long but it feels epic) and the engaging, melodic "Leo". These are just some of the highlights as every song on Zodiac is good, even the campy "Cancer". Yes, camp is an element present on Zodiac but the songwriting is so strong--balancing pop metal vocal melodies with aggressive Iron Maiden-type riffs--the campy lyrics can easily be overlooked. In the end, the combination of catchy melodies and heavy metal crunch makes Zodiac one of my all-time favorite albums. Vocalist/songwriter Keith Sudano is one of the best prog metal vocalists ever, in my opinion. It is difficult to compare Mr. Sudano to other vocalists and Zodiac isn't quite his best work vocally (all the vocals were recorded in one day), but Sudano's voice falls somewhere along the lines of an aggressive James LaBrie (Dream Theater) or a rougher Geoff Tate (Queensryche). As for bassist Zeek, he is clearly from the Steve Harris (Iron Maiden) school of bass guitarists and lead guitarist Kevin Riepl sounds like a mix of Eddie Van Halen and Maiden's classic guitar duo of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith. If you want an album that combines fun, melody and aggression, pick up Zodiac. Iron Maiden and 80s pop metal fans may get a kick out of this one. If you're afraid of the pop metal comparisons I keep making, don't worry. Zodiac is heavy metal--even heavier than Iron Maiden--so you need not worry. It just so happens Zodiac is extremely catchy in the vocal melody department. And that makes Zodiac one of my all-time favorites. 
A110AP71Q2CS1R 0812502108 July 13, 2001 5 5 4.0 The Saga of the Black Company Continues... The Black Company saga continues as Lady, assuming that Croaker has died, becomes Captain of the Black Company. She assembles legions of cast-offs and wannabes and molds them into a fierce fighting force. Unfortunately, she unintentionally adds members of a mysterious murder cult to her ranks. Ultimately, they will betray her and rob her of a most precious gift. Good story and it is fun to finally have a Black Company novel told from someone else's point of view besides Croaker (the Silver Spike did this but is it really a Black Company novel?). Lady tells the story and author Glen Cook does an excellent job of distinguishing her from Croaker. Be warned: The murder cult portrayed in this novel will give you nightmares. It did me. Tired of Tolkien-esque epic fantasy? Does it all read the same after awhile? Try Glen Cook and the Black Comapny novels. Good stuff. Dark fantasy told from the soldiers' point of view. The first one in the series is titled the Black Company. Shadows Linger is second followed by the White Rose, the Silver Spike (even though this one doesn't deal with the Black Company directly), Shadow Games and then Dream of Steel. Bleak Seasons, She is the Darkness, Water Sleeps and Soldiers Live finish off the series--so far. 
A110AP71Q2CS1R B000003K8R May 2, 2001 1 1 5.0 Worf finally gets it! Interspecies fun! I remember watching the fourth season of Deep Space Nine--the first season with Worf--and yelling at the television screen. It seemed so obvious to me that TNG's Worf and DS9's Science Officer Jadzia Dax were a perfect match. Yet Worf seemed oblivious to Dax's advances--hints, really. I mean, Dax has a history with Klingons--her soul is Klingon--yet it just wasn't happening. But, finally, "Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places" hooks the pair up--and it does so in a humorous and clever way. Throughout the episode, Worf is either trying to catch Quark's ex-wife Grilka (a Klingon) or help Quark renew the fragile romance he (Quark) and Grilka once had (What would a Klingon/Ferengi child look like, anyway? And do we want to find out?). And Jadzia Dax is giving Worf all kinds of hints and suggestions, which Worf is not getting. This is a fun episode and the ending is great when Worf and Dax finally hook-up. "Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places" is essential Worf. It's essential Dax. Heck, it's essential Deep Space Nine! 
A110AP71Q2CS1R 0792147391 July 7, 2000 6 6 3.0 Dr. Crusher Does Something Interesting! The Next Generation's women are weak. I don't know if this is because the actresses, Gates McFadden as Dr. Crusher, Marina Sirtis as Counslor Troi and (ugh) Denise Crosby as Lt. Yar, were incompetent or the writers/creators of TNG just did not know how to write women (I suspect the latter though Crosby is a poor actress regardless) but they just did not do much on TNG (especially early on) and have, in my opinion, been fairly weak characters (though both Troi and Crusher grew stronger as characters later in TNG's run). I'm not anti-woman here, just anti-bad characters/bad writers. I sometimes wonder if our TNG trio of women was hired for their appearance rather than their acting ability. "Suspicions" is not a great episode but at least Dr. Crusher is interesting here as she attempts to solve the murder of a Ferengi scientist. The mystery is secondary to me because I'm more interested with Dr. Crusher's rebellion in this episode. She defies Starfleet regulations, Federation protocol, Captain Picard's orders and Ferengi tradition all in the name of justice. Go Doctor go! I don't mean to put down the mystery (it's actually fairly clever) but I appreciated a strong and well-rounded Dr. Crusher more than the particulars of a "whodunnit". Good episode, I could've given it four stars instead of three but what the heck. 
A110AP71Q2CS1R 0792147359 July 3, 2000 11 14 4.0 Captain Picard in Die Hard: The Next Generation Sometimes Star Trek: The Next Generation gets bogged down by pretentious moral studies or pompous political agendizing in it's storytelling. Once in a while, though, TNG steps back from it's oft-times arrogant posturing and gives us a solid action-adventure yarn. "Starship Mine" is such an episode and it succeeds because it is simply this: Picard is trapped alone on the Enterprise with ruthless thieves who are trying to steal "trilithium resin", a lethal substance given off by the Enterprise's engines that can be used to make terrorist weapons of mass destruction. This episode greatly resembles the first Die Hard movie in it's plot and Captian Picard is Bruce Willis here. Picard foils the plans of the thieves and saves the day through cleverness and a few fist-fights. Fun episode and a welcome change of pace for this excellent series that need not have an important moral tale to tell every single episode. It's okay to step back and present the viewer with a rousing adventure such as "Starship Mine". 
A110AP71Q2CS1R B000007UB1 June 16, 2000 1 1 4.0 Exposed: "Standard" Hair Metal + Virtuoso Guitar Work Do you like Motley Crue? Billy Idol? Damn Yankess? What about GREAT guitar work? Pick up this album, man, what are you waiting for? Former Motley Crue vocalist Vince Neil teams with former Billy Idol guitarist Steve Stevens and the result is some damn, fine hair metal. Vince Neil, Steve Stevens, former Ozzy bassist Phil Soussan, Jack Blades of Night Ranger/Damn Yankees and Tommy Shaw of Styx/Damn Yankees write all the songs on this album. It's a good combo and it works (Soussan, Blades and Shaw don't play on this release, by the way). Steve Stevens gives us guitar work that really smokes, maybe somewhat like Steve Vai or Joe Satriani and even Adrian Vandenburg in style. So what we have here is good hair metal with virtuoso guitar playing. This album rocks with a sassy, sleazy attitude and all the songs are catchy and infectious, this could easily be mistaken for a Motley Crue album (depending on which songs you are listening to). Seriously, the guitar work on this album is as good as I've made it out to be. Normally, hair metal isn't associated with virtuoso playing but there have been exceptions (Extreme, White Lion) and this is one of those exceptions. If this CD had been released in the '80s or very early '90s, it would have been a huge hit. Unfortunately, Vince Neil's debut album was released in '93. And by that time, grunge ruled the airwaves. 
A110AP71Q2CS1R B000006E4T June 7, 2000 0 0 5.0 The Wake of Magellan: Epic Metal Epic metal. That is what Savatage is: epic metal. Way back in the early '80s, Savatage started off as a Black Sabbath/Judas Priest-type band. As the years went by, Savatage began adding progressive and art-rock influeces to their sound. The result was a type of heavy metal that is pompous, dramatic and extravagant. The rssult is epic metal not unlike that of Iron Maiden. This is metal that uses the piano on nearly ever song, courtesy of Jon Oliva. Zak Stevens, Savatage's vocalist, has a voice that is very much opera-ish but with an edge to it -- it's a combination of Geoff Tate (Queensryche) and James Hetfield (Metallica). The music on The Wake of Magellan can be heavy and powerful or soft and enchanting -- sometimes in the same song. Highlights include the powerful and dark "Blackjack Guillotine", the fast-paced "Turns To Me", the epic "The Wake of Magellan" and the sprawling finale, "The Hourglass". Similiar bands MIGHT be Judas Priest, Royal Hunt, Iron Maiden, Queen and Ayreon but Savatage has a unique sound all their own and any comparisons I make do not do Savatage justice. Savatage is, simply put, Savatage. 
A110GFTXGR8HQ0 0765300419 June 2, 2002 26 27 5.0 I was not disappointed After my experience with other Norton series resuming with a co-author (Solar Queen's new books I read and quickly shelved to gather dust; Time Agents I enjoyed and re-read) I was a little concerned when I saw a new Beast Master book due out. Could they recapture what I loved in my all time favorite of Norton's SF? They did. Yes, there is a new character, a female character, and a beastmaster herself. But she's not just a female version of Hosteen Storm. Tani is a well-developed independant character, with her own distinct personality and past. Everything fits in with the pevious books. And the danger is suspenseful and well handled. I would have enjoyed this book even if it was not part of a series, but to see Storm, Logan, Brad; Surra, Baku, and Hing; all of my favorites - portrayed as I remembered them and in a story that kept me interested to the end was wonderful. And we even got to see more about the planet and its natives;and a bit more on the history that brought things to where they are. There's another book in the series coming, and I eagerly await it. It's very hard for a writer to bring in a new partner and resume an old series. But Norton and McConchie pulled it off in grand style with this one. Bravo! 
A110GFTXGR8HQ0 B00000612U August 14, 2000 2 2 5.0 Well, 4 1/2 rounded up This album, like his first solo effort, got caught up in problems the record company was experiencing or we would have seen a lot more action on these because they are both excellent albums by an artist who can obviously stand on his own. Unlike his first solo effort, most of these songs are not written by Peter. His distinctive style and voice still make them worth listening to. This album shows a more varied selection, which makes the album a showcase of his wide range. Soft songs, fast songs, pop to rock to a little hint of about everything are here. Peter is already working on several solo projects for when the Farewell Tour for KISS finishes. This album provides a hint of what he can give us. For an appetizer of what's to come, check out this and his previous solo albums (OUT OF CONTROL and the KISS Peter Criss solo album). 
A110GFTXGR8HQ0 0672313510 April 26, 2000 1 1 1.0 Sams Teach Yourself Visual J++ 6 in 21 Days I had used other 'Teach yourself' something 'in XX days' before and liked them. I sure got fooled with this one! Avoid this book unless you are already comfortable working with J++. The examples are confusing. It rambles. It presents bits and pieces but never gives you a solid foundation. I really regret buying this book. 
A110SXBC1UMFZA 0850456886 March 30, 2000 5 9 3.0 Good as a painting guide! Osprey's Men-At-Arms seriesmay be the greatest source for depicting how historical warrior's dressed and may give you a good pallette for painting wargames miniatures, but the facts they quote as history leave alot to be desired. The illustrations are wonderful and the b&w photos of artifacts are interesting but a serious student of history can find better sources other than this book. I give them 5 stars on the pictures but only 1 on the subject matter at hand. 
A110TZRQM6DM8J 0826413838 July 27, 2002 10 12 5.0 A fearless uncovering of a silenced apostle. This is a unique, powerful and provocative work. Something I've come to expect from this wonderful scholar and writer. 
A110TZRQM6DM8J 0312866143 October 23, 1999 9 9 5.0 Simply Superb Gene Wolfe is a treasure. A true original. Authors hold him in awe. Readers fumble trying to express the magic of his work. Astounding stories, perfect craft, and a depth of emotional and philosophical courage that is nearly impossible to describe. Among its many delights and shocks, ON BLUE'S WATERS is perhaps the most moving portrait of a haunted man that I have ever read. Under the guise of a typical science fiction extended adventure series Wolfe is creating an entirely new thing: a meditation on the journey of faith and the search for truth refracted through a dazzling array of unforgettable characters. Why doesn't everyone know Gene Wolfe is the best writer alive today? 
A110UC3LQWCDQ6 B00005214X February 11, 2001 6 6 5.0 A CLASSIC ALBUM ALL THNGS MUST PASS is a brilliant album which features Harrison at his peak as a songwriter and guitarist. There are some great Harrison solos here (along with scorchers from Eric Clapton)and out-of-this-world slide guitar work. This is hardly mentioned. George Harrison pioneered the sitar in pop music and the 12 string Rickenbacker sound that everybody ripped off from him. Harrison also developed the guitar riffs that are featured on this album (WAH-WAH, WHAT IS LIFE). Harrison is underappreciated and neglected as a guitarist, but this album shows him to be one of the greats. Listen to his solo on ISN'T IT A PITY or WAH-WAH. Moreover, people forget that in 1971 Harrison released THE CONCERT FOR BANGLADESH, another musical milestone that won Grammy album of the year and featured Bob Dylan, Ravi Shanker in one of the first benefit concerts. The 3 record set was brilliant. So this album is only PART 1. PART 2 is the Bangladesh concert.On this album, every song is great, there is no filler. Harrison also has a certain drive and conviction here. It is a milestone in rock music. This album is deserving of the praise. More people should listen to it. If MC HAMMER and MILLI VANILLI can sell over 0 million records, why can't really brilliant music sell? This is the real deal. Harrison is at peak form as vocalist and guitarist. His playing is understated, less-is-more. Clapton adds more firepower. Buy this album. You won't be disappointed. 
A110XBZ54XSUWR 0060081597 September 11, 2005 15 16 5.0 Thank You, Dr. Atkins I feel like my review for Dr. Atkins' diet is long overdue. At 19, I was 5'6" and 227 lbs. I looked horrible, I didn't like getting out of breath on small hills, and I didn't feel comfortable in my own body. Feeling frustrated and miserable, I ordered the New Diet Revolution. It was difficult to initially ditch carbohydrates and switch to all protein and veggies. Once I got past the first few days, though, I was on the road to success. I saw a weight loss of 2-3 lbs. a week, which was encouraging. The Atkins chocolate shakes and bars were a nice occasional treat. In four months, I had lost 40 lbs. just by following the diet and not exercising. It was so nice to be in the 100-pound range again, and it was nice to see my face and body melting. When you're 200+ lbs., you don't really know where to start. Dr. Atkins made the plan simple and easy, and didn't require exercise to see the results. Once I got to the stage where I didn't feel so helpless and hopeless, thinking it'd be impossible to be slim, I incorporated exercise and switched my eating plan. I started eating sensibly, while still using the basic principles the New Diet Revolution taught me. Atkins allowed me to lose my sweet tooth (for pop, chocolate, cake, and cookies), taught me what reasonable portions were (to feel full, not stuffed from gorging), and allowed me to see the numerous benefits to exercise, which I engage in six days a week. A year later, and I'm over 100 lbs. lighter. I am 5'6, 121 lbs., and feel much more comfortable in my body. I love shopping for cute polos and jeans, which I couldn't have fit into previously. Dr. Atkins' saved me - he saved my self-image, self-esteem, and my health. I wish I had him to thank personally; I never thought I'd see the day I'd fit into a size 4 pair of jeans. Thank you so much for changing me, Dr. Atkins, and allowing me to lose those initial 40 lbs. that prevented me from changing who I was. 
A1110E06W6VWO3 0345405404 April 24, 2000 9 15 3.0 Not Quite As Good This book is exhaustively researched, but lacks the style and emotional impact of Weir's earlier works. Perhaps this is due to the dearth of reliable information on Eleanor of Aquitaine. Certainly, she was no less interesting than Elizabeth I! 
A1110E06W6VWO3 630296959X April 6, 2000 7 7 5.0 One of Portman's Best Haunting, troubling, hilarious, and saddening. Eric Portman was England's greatest actor, and he and the rest of the cast shine in this underrated gem about the nature of truth. 
A1110E06W6VWO3 0747255229 March 24, 2000 4 7 4.0 Exhaustive Great book, but full of too much detail on items of minor importance, and not enough detail on more important aspects of the Ripper crimes. The entry on Edward Buchan, who committed suicide late in 1888, is particularly pointless and gives no evidence that he was the Ripper. 
A11111P8D1L4U1 0783235070 January 13, 2000 6 8 3.0 Liar Liar Collector Edition DVD This review is in reference to the collector's edition DVD. I love the movie and I thought I would spend a little extra getting the special edition DVD vs. the regular DVD, but I don't really feel it was worth it. The "outtakes" are only 30 seconds in total. "Bridging the comedy chasm" was about 15 minutes long and wasn't terribly exciting or insightful. My recommendation is to skip the collector's version 
A1111IH33M1RC8 0874850339 February 28, 2005 8 8 5.0 19th Century Benjamin Franklin It bemuses me that so few people know of this American hero; William Still was born of an escaped slave in Delaware and moved early in life to Philadelphia, where, by dint of perserverance and personal sweat, he managed to teach himself to read and write and become a major industrialist in 19th-Century Philadelphia. He became an officer of the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society, and was instrumental in turning it from cheerleading meetings to active MI-9-like evasion and escape assistance for slaves, forming the first of the so-called "vigilance committees". He was the first to have undercover agents on the docks and railroad stations of SE Pennsylvania, where Southern plantation owners transitted with their "properties" on their travels. The book is Brother Still's after-action report initially published by subscription. It is a collection of spectacular, tragic escape stories, some black genealogists today using it for family research. Of particular interest is the network of men Still was able to utilize, putting themselves at risk from federal marshals after 1851 and the Fugitive Slave Act, who volunteered immediate clandestine assistance to escapees of another race. Whence came such a moral, secret enterprise? That's easy, William Still was a Pennsylvania Freemason. His grave is in Eden Cemetery in Delaware County, and should be paid respect by all Pennsylvania Freemasons, as he did more for the City of Philadelphia than anyone except Benjamin Franklin (also a Pennsylvania Freemason). This edition is out of print, but copies may be had from used bookselllers, and I understand the Johnson House Underground Railroad Museum in Philadelphia has hosted the issue of a new edition in February 2005. 
A1111IH33M1RC8 0766100731 April 13, 2002 5 5 5.0 The Constitutions of the FreeMasons Wonderful that copies of this little book are still in circulation for any FreeMason or historically- or philosophically-minded reader to peruse. Rev James Anderson wrote this to attempt to regularize the workings of lodges of speculative "Masons" as distinct from trade guilds of operative or stone- Masons. The governance of societies of FreeMasons and the charges upon their individual behaviors both inside the lodge and outside in the profane world show how this confraternity has elevated benevolence to one's fellow man to a high (Royal?) Art. Even though written in the 18th Century, for thinking men of all levels of society to live the Enlightement and oppose religious and ethnic prsecution, there is little in Aderson's Constitutions which is not applicable to human society today. I am proud that my lodge left Philadelphia during its occupation by the British in 1778 and Wintered with the Continental Army at Valley Forge; there were many collaborators in Philadelphia, but there were a few who saw where we were going. The intolerant, the authoritarian, the supremacists have always acted against Masonic lodges upon first gaining power; did you ever wonder why?... 
A1115ST6F5CWYP 1401900577 May 17, 2006 0 0 5.0 Great Problem Solving Techniques to change your attitude This is a very useful book if there is a problem in your life that you are trying to solve. Much of this book is related to interactions and the resulting problems that come up when dealing with other people. But, isn't that where most of us run into trouble in our lives? This book outlines very useful problem solving techniques that most of use could use a refresher course on when life gets tough, or we "get stuck". I purchased this book because as a 40-something woman I know that I need to develop and stick to a structured exercise routine, yet I don't do it. I have been avoiding this issue for years and finally decided that I needed to find out why I can't commit to an exercise routine. Well, according to Dr. Browne I just need to do it. And then it will become a habit and I will get the same end result, consistent exercise. Can we all say duh? Okay, now I know that was an easy answer, and I am an educated woman, so why didn't I think of that? Sometimes it really is much easier to solve problems when they are someone else's, and not your own. Dr. Browne subdivides her book as follows: Step 1: Time Shifting (Figure out where you are) Step 2: Patterns (Remember where you have been) Step 3: Self-Awareness (See yourself) Step 4: Perspective (See your world) Step 5: Building Blocks (Find and use the right materials) Step 6: Goals (Know what you want) Step 7: A Dozen Tools (that allow you to see the big picture clearly) Step 8: Interactions (Know that the only behavior you can control is your own) In the preface to the book Dr. Brown details the 13 self-defeating steps that many people do to stay stuck in their life. These behaviors will be very enlightening to some. My personal favorite two were, "find someone to blame" and "host frequent pity parties for yourself". We all know people like this; they are ones that we all try to avoid. Dr. Browne did a wonder job of succinctly describing the tools that she uses to problem solve. The techniques that she describes are what I would call tried and true methods for solving problems. However, she explains these techniques in very simple terms that even a teenager could understand. In fact, I think this book would make a nice gift for a child in college or just out of college and on there own. There is nice discussion about identifying patterns in your life and working to correct those that aren't working well for you any longer. The passage on letting go of grudges was also particularly well written. If you are experiencing a problem that you haven't been able to solve on your own, this book might just have the techniques to help you get to the root of the problem and get on with your life. The book is written in a conversational tone and is a very easy and pleasant read. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP B0000BXJIU April 21, 2006 0 0 5.0 Cats run right to you when you shake this bag I picked up a bag of these treats at our neighborhood market. My cats think this is the best stuff on earth. My little darlings have not enjoyed anything as much as they appear to love these. The only problem with these treats is that the cats love them so much they sometimes get in little squabbles as each one tries to reach my hand before anyone else can get to the treat. If you want to feed you felines an organic diet, and you want them to eat what you give them this is a great product. My husband continues to threaten to try one since they are all organic, and a nice mix of food that people would eat. I highly recommend this for anyone with pampered felines. Mine give these three paws up.

A1115ST6F5CWYP 0517503875 April 18, 2006 1 1 5.0 quick easy Italian cooking, mostly authentic This review is written from the perspective of a serious home cook that has been studying cooking for 25 years, and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last ten. This book is a wonderful addition to any Italian cookbook library. If you were looking for a good basic Italian cookbook to begin you Italian cooking library this would make a wonderful start. This cookbook is simple Italian cooking at its best. Most of the recipes in this book are quick (Panettone excluded). I always use the cannoli recipe from this book it just works. The author also does a nice job of highlighting the regional differences in preparing dishes. I highly recommend this book for anyone that is interested in Italian cooking. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP 0684800012 April 17, 2006 3 3 5.0 The only cooking science reference you will ever need This review is written from the perspective of a very serious home cook that has been studying food and cooking for 25 years. If food is your hobby you will love this book. In addition to this book I also own Shirley Corriher's "Cookwise" and Alton Brown's "I'm Only Here For The Food". If you are just interested in science this is the book to purchase. This book answers any question that you can image, and it does so in excruciating detail. If you can think of a food science question this book has answered it. This book is definitely a technical reference and not a cookbook. Please do not purchase this book expecting recipes you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a combination of science and recipes than check out one of the two books referenced above by Shirley Corriher and Alton Brown. This book is a highly recommend for anyone that wants to know why a particular method is recommended, or what chemical reaction is taking place. Just be warned this is a dry read. I use if only for reference, it is far too dry to read cover to cover. I am very happy to have this book in my cooking reference library. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP B000FBO0M8 April 14, 2006 0 0 5.0 Excellent eye protection, and stylish too! I love, love, love these glasses!!!!! I purchased these approximately 4 years ago and have been thrilled with them since I got them. The eye surgeon that performed by Lasik procedure also approved of the lenses in these glasses. I guess we can have form and function together in some items! Who knew? I am rather hard on things and usually scratch sunglass lenses in a year or two. So far, these have held up extremely well. I don't think that I have gotten any more delicate in my handling of items. I believe these lenses must be made of a harder carbonate material. I highly recommend this product. I would gladly purchase another pair. My husband also has Maui Jim glasses and is equally happy with his purchase. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP 0743293010 April 13, 2006 13 14 4.0 well written, good guide for everyone I was a hospital administrator for just under two decades so most of this information is second nature to me. I purchased this book because I liked the general style of "You: The Owner's Manual" and was curious to see how the doctors tackled this subject. I have been impressed with the way they were able to take out much of the unnecessary medical and hospital terminology and get to the point for the rest of us. The book is subdivided as follows: 1. Getting to Know You (Information that is important to convey to your doctor) 2. Finding Doctor Right (not all doctors are created equal, 50% of all doctors finished medical school in the bottom 50% or their graduating class) 3. Let's Play Operational (what you should know if you are scheduling surgery) 4. Prescription Drugs 5. How to Case a Hospital (choosing a safe hospital) 6. Have a Happily Humdrum Hospital Stay 7. Why You Should Always Get a Second Opinion 8. Just What Gives You the Right (Patient Rights) 9. Considering the Alternatives (Alternative Medicine) 10. Take Control of Your Health Insurance Appendix 1: Medical Jargon Explained Appendix 2: Sample Forms (Your Health Journal, Living Will, Power of Attorney for Health Care, Do Not Resuscitate Order) Appendix 3: Resources If you know someone that has been diagnosed with cancer, or will be undergoing surgery this is a nice book to buy. The doctors cover a lot of important topics like: making certain a hospital has JCAHO accreditation (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, checking the doctor's board certification, understanding HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, knowing drug interactions and getting second opinions. All of these things are extremely important and will impact your care if not your health. If you don't work in a healthcare setting, I recommend reading this book before something happens to your health and you end up in the hospital. I read somewhere that almost half of us will have an inpatient stay in the hospital prior to the end of our lives. I don't think we can ever be too prepared for something that can have such an impact on our lives, or the life of someone that we love. As a former member of the hospital community I can tell you that the doctor and hospital that you select can have a tremendous impact on the outcome you experience. Why take a chance, know the facts, and know your rights. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP B000B7S52W April 12, 2006 0 0 4.0 very mild, nice flavor I purchased this product to combat "tuna breath" for my felines. The cats gave it one try and decided they did not like it. However, I find the flavor to be very mild and nice. I have placed this in my purse for those times when I am out and away from a toothbrush. I had been a user of the Listerine strips. The flavor on this product is vastly superior to the Listerine strips if you prefer a milder taste. I would highly recommend this product for people. However, the cats in my home give this product a rating of three paws down. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP B0006G2WYK April 10, 2006 1 1 5.0 nice product, good range I purchased this product because we have a four-story house and I did not want to be stuck near the kitchen to hear the temperature gauge sound. The range on this product is exceptional. Being three floors away from the base unit was not too far for the receiving sensor; it still functioned as it was designed. I have also been outside the house in the yard and the sensor still worked appropriately. I use this product mostly in the oven. If takes the guess work out of large cuts of meat. The beef temperature that is preset is too high for my taste. But, I know this and just monitor the temperature and know that the alarm will not sound until the meat is overcooked, in my opinion. As one of the other viewers indicated you do have to "synchronize" the base and receiving until by pressing the reset button on both items after installing the batteries and turning both products on. Check the directions, they spell out the process. The belt clip and/or table stand is a nice feature of the product. Another highly recommend product. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP B00006WNMP April 9, 2006 1 1 5.0 very nice product, performs as I expected I have had this immersion blender for more than six months. It is wonderful for pureeing soups and sauces in the pot, eliminating the possibility of burning yourself when transferring hot items to the blender or food processor. I have found that whipping cream is best done in a very cold bowl with a whisk or with a stand mixer. If you want an easy appliance for whipping cream buy a whipped cream canister that you charge with gas, they work great. Check out the ISI 2470 Thermo Whip - Polished Stainless canister at Amazon. The product is also easy to clean if you put the blade end in a vessel of warm soapy water as the manufacturer recommends. I highly recommend this product. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP B0006IVZ3C May 12, 2006 0 0 5.0 Excellent product, highly recommended! A serious foodie that has been perfecting her cooking skills for the last 25 years in her home kitchen writes this review. My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America and "Culinary Artistry". I received this product for Christmas and I love it. My husband purchased this in a set of both salt and pepper grinders for me. One has a ceramic grinding mechanism and the one has a stainless grinding mechanism. We liked the first set so much that we purchased a second set within a week. Now we have one with black peppercorn, another with white peppercorns. The salt grinders are filled with Trapani (Sicilian) Sea Salt, and Grey Salt. I love that these can be used with one hand. I also love that they are so easy to clean with a damp cloth. If you will be handling meat you can cover the button mechanism with a piece of plastic wrap prior to handling the meat and then just remove the plastic film when you are finished. I find the adjustment mechanism to be more than adequate. We had to fiddle with it a little to get a coarse enough grind, but it took less than 5 minutes. We prefer to see the salt and pepper on the top of our food. If you use these are often as we do, you might want to consider purchasing rechargeable batteries for this product. These grinders get enough of a workout in our home that each of the four grinders has already been through 2 sets of batteries since this past Christmas. This is one of those products that I would give to any of my foodie friends. It is just so much nicer to be able to grind spices with one hand. This product is well weighted and feels nice in the hand. I highly recommend this product; you will not be disappointed with this purchase. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP 068481465X April 8, 2006 2 3 5.0 Answers any question you might ever have about the home If you are like me your mother didn't teach you how to maintain a home. My family wanted me to have a career not be a wife. The problem was that I went into the world with no skills in the home care arena. Finding this book has been a godsend. Ms. Mendelson covers every topic that you could possibly want to know anything about. The chapter on hiring help and protecting yourself legally particularly impressed me. This is a topic that more than a few Supreme Court nominees could have learned a lot by reading. I have referred to the book many times since purchasing it a few years back. It is a wonderful resource for stain removal. I also learned a lot about cleaning to reduce allergens and on how to set up a cleaning system so that the house never gets out of control. Ms. Mendelson has had a very positive impact on the quality of life at my house. If you feel as though you are stumbling through the process of cleaning your home, this is the book for you. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP 0375407553 May 11, 2006 3 3 5.0 Excellent book, easy to read and complete This review is written by a former hospital administrator of just under 2 decades. I have been studying health and nutrition for more than decade. I became very interested in alternative medicine when a family member was diagnosed with kidney cancer and the allopathic doctors (traditional MD's) could give no reason for the tumor. If you have not read one of Dr. Weil's books before, I think you will enjoy his writing style. His tone is very conversational, you feel as though you are talking to a friend while you are reading his books, this one included. Dr. Weil has a gift for taking a dry and complicated subject and explaining it in a manner that anyone can understand. The purpose of this book is NOT to stop aging, but rather to prevent or minimize the impact of age-related disease, to learn how to live long and well, and to age gracefully. He subdivides his book as follows: PART ONE: The Science and Philosophy of Healthy Aging 1. Immortality 2. Shangri-Las and Fountains of Youth 3. Antiaging Medicine 4. Why We Age 5. The Denial of Aging 6. The Value of Aging 7. Interlude: Jenny PART TWO: How to Age Gracefully 8. Body I: The Ounce of Prevention 9. Body II: The Anti-inflammatory Diet 10. Body III: Supplements 11. Body IV: Physical Activity 12. Body V: Rest and Sleep 13. Body VI: Touch and Sex 14. Mind I: Stress 15. Mind II: Thoughts, Emotions, and Attitudes 16. Mind III: Memory 17. Spirit I: Unchanging Essence 18. Spirit II: Legacy A TWELEVE PROGRAM FOR HEALTHY AGING Appendix A: The Anti-inflammatory Diet Appendix B: Suggested Readings, Resources and Supplies The doctor does a wonderful job of explaining why and how we age. Even without an educational background in the sciences I was able to comprehend advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and how they cross link (form abnormal bonds) to adjacent protein strands leading to inflammatory and autoimmune responses. If you have been reading much about nutrition or health lately you know that inflammation is the new "hot topic" in medicine linked to almost everything. According to Cardiologists inflammation is more important in determining heart health than cholesterol. After reading Dr. Weil's explanation of inflammatory response this concept now makes much more sense to me. Dr. Weil explains in great detail which nutrients the body requires to function properly and how to incorporate them into your life. He also goes into much detail about dietary suggestions. These are pretty much what you would expect, but he does a thorough job of explaining why he is making these recommendations, which I personally find very helpful. The doctor also goes into great detail regarding his recommendations for physical activity and how this should change as we age. The concept of a pool disinfected without chlorine was new to me, and one that I was very happy to know is an option. If you want to age gracefully, but feel as though you need more information, this is a wonderful book on the subject. I highly recommend this book to baby boomers looking for information on how to minimize or eliminate the impact of disease in our lives as we grow older. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP 0060009357 May 5, 2006 6 6 5.0 Excellent recipes geared to cooking and nutrition beginners To put my review in perspective for you I have been focused on food and cooking for the last 25 years. I have been reading anything about nutrition and health for the last 10 years. Additionally, I was a hospital administrator for just under 2 decades. So I know the effect that unhealthy lifestyle decisions can make on the human body. If you are a new student of health or nutrition this is an excellent place to begin your research. I enjoyed the predecessor to this book "The Real Age Makeover". I appreciated the doctor's unique approach to healthy food and lifestyle and the way that he tried to quantify specific changes on your health by using age. This book is a great tie in to the original book. The author does cover the basic information from "The Real Age Makeover" in this book. If your don't want to read about the science of how the specific changes work, you can simply purchase this book "Cooking the Real Age Way" and skip the prior book. The author outlines the 27 practices for food choices that can bring about at Real Age reduction of 14 years. Many of these practices are common sense, like eat food that isn't processed. But some of the practices are less obvious, like eat 10 tablespoons of tomato sauce every week. This book is geared to those that are kitchen beginners. The doctors explain many cooking techniques that experienced cooks think are second nature. But for those that are accustomed to relying on carry out these sections are critical to their success. The doctors also discuss how to effectively use the freezer so that ingredients are readily available for quick weeknight meals. The authors do a nice job of detailing what should be included in a healthy pantry. If you are new to healthy cooking a healthy pantry is key to being able to make fast healthy meals for your family. Without healthy quick options at the ready it is so much easier to call for pizza or Chinese, and neither of these delivery options are particularly healthy. The doctors also created tables of vegetables by season and detail what to look for in the specific fresh vegetable, how to use them, and why they are good for your health. The recipe section of the book begins on page 155. The doctors also provide an exhaustive nutritional analysis. Every possible item is detailed included milligrams of specific vitamins and minerals. The recipes themselves are good, but not too exotic for the standard American palate. The directions are clearly written. The ingredients are available in your standard mega mart (Wegman's or Whole Foods) anywhere in the US. If you need a go-to cookbook that is healthy this is a good choice. There are many other options available that you might also consider, my personal favorites are "The Professional Chef's Techniques of Healthy Cooking" by the Culinary Institute of America, and "Conscious Cuisine" by Cary Neff. If you are new to cooking, and more specifically healthy cooking this is great book to get you started. If you have been cooking for a while, but want to cook more healthy meals for your family you should consider the two books I referenced in the last paragraph. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP B0006NXPBW May 2, 2006 0 0 5.0 Fabulous for dry cracked skin This product is designed in 1899 for farmers to use on Dairy Cows to keep them from becoming chapped in the harsh Vermont environment. There are only two ingredients in this product these are a petrolatum lanolin base and an ingredient call 8 - hydroxy quinoline sulfate that is 3% of the total. I use this product on the soles of my feet in the winter when they are very dry and cracked. My brother-in-law uses it on his German Shepherd stomach when she has contact dermatitis. If you have dry skin anywhere on your body this is a nice product to have around. Be certain to cover the area with socks or clothing after applying the product. It is very thick and might leave a stain if not laundered properly. I use a combination of Oxyclean and Spray and Wash to remove it from my socks when I treat my feet. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP B00004SGF1 April 30, 2006 4 4 5.0 Much more useful than I anticipated Since I am one of those people that has every kitchen gadget known to mankind I wasn't certain this would get much use in my kitchen. I was wrong. With this mixer and its balloon whisk attachment, which is included, I am able to do anything that I previously used a non-powered whisk to perform. There is an optional attachment to turn this into an immersion blender, for those that don't already have one. I expected this mixer to be heavy, like all the other kitchen aid appliances. It is much lighter than I expected, which is a good thing. My arm did not tire using this mixer as much as it would with a regular balloon whisk. Having the power buttons integrated into the face of the machine makes this appliance much easier to clean than the older machines with the buttons. No little crevices for "crud" to accumulate. America's test kitchen rated the Kitchen Aid mixer (7 speed) very highly which is why I purchased this one. This is a highly recommend item, in my opinion. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP 0316710709 April 26, 2006 0 0 5.0 Must have for anyone traveling to Italy that loves food I have used this book extensively during two trips to Italy, which covered approximately 45 days. This book is invaluable if you want to experience Italy like a "real" Italian. The author does a nice job explaining the various types of eating establishments (ristoranti, trattoria, osteria, enoteca, tavola calda, etc.) and how what you can expect in those establishments is different. The author also does a fabulous job of listing the various names for food stores and what they sell. This is extremely helpful if your Italian is weak or nonexistent. Also helpful for the first time visitor to Italy is the discussion of how to purchase something in a food shop. Most Americans are unfamiliar with the concept of paying first at the cashier, and then taking the ticket to the person who will prep your food. But in a gelateria or pizza shop this is just how it is done. Also nice, is how the author explains the table charge (or cover charge), what it is for, and that is optional since many locals will stand at the bar to eat. Regional specialties are covered in this book in reasonable detail. This is very helpful for getting into the spirit of a place and enjoying what is native to their geography. The Italians are very big on this notion and are fiercely loyal to their own products. If you want to fit in like an Italian, it is helpful to know how what you order in Firenze is different from Roma, or Venezia. I have found the authors recommendations on restaurants to be right on target. Many of the restaurants he recommends I had been in prior to purchasing this book and found that I agreed with his selections. I highly recommend this book for anyone that loves food, and wants to enjoy the best that Italy has to offer. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP B00011RTE8 April 25, 2006 1 1 5.0 I use these boards multiple times every day These flexible cutting boards do exactly what I purchased them to do. 1. eliminate cross contamination by making it easier to keep the meat off the vegetable board. 2. keep me from scarring my counter or wooden board. 3. make it easy to transfer cut food directly into the pan without getting my dough blade dirty (I used to use this to move chopped items from the cutting board into the pan or bowl). These boards are reasonably thin, which is why they are flexible. I have had two sets for approximately 5 months and will be replacing them soon because they are starting to show significant scarring which I am concerned is accumulating dirt. For those that aren't as obsessive compulsive the boards would probably last twice as long. My wear patterns are from extreme use. I cook everyday and usually for all meals for my family. Since we began concentrating on eating more fruits and vegetables, these boards have gotten a serious workout and have held up better than the other flexible boards that I have tried. I use these so often that they never make it into the dishwasher. They are easy to wash by hand, and I like to soak them in a weak bleach solution (10%) every day just to be certain they are clean. I wasn't certain these would hold up to the daily bleaching, but they have. My only complaint is that these slide around a little on the counter. I have found that if you place them on top of a wooden cutting board they do not move around so much. It also works if you place a silicone pastry mat (Silpat) or a couple of silicone potholders under the mat. I highly recommend these to anyone that is concerned with cross contamination. 
A1115ST6F5CWYP B000660MT2 April 24, 2006 0 0 5.0 Nice tea good flavor If you are a trying to increase your consumption of tea in general, and green tea specifically to increase your antioxidants this is a good place to start. In the past I have found green tea to be a little bland. This tea has a little more flavor than most teas, and therefore is more like the standard black tea that most of us of accustomed to. I would also suggest the Earl Grey and Irish Breakfast green teas for the same reason, more flavor. Try making a pitcher of tea with half green tea and half black tea. My husband (a green tea hater) will even drink tea prepared in that half and half manner without complaint. I highly recommend this tea for those that are looking for a green tea with more flavor. 
A1123L7ANYUTG0 B00005AUKD November 1, 2003 2 10 2.0 a grossly overpraised dud I'd heard a lot of positive things about this picture for a long time from people whose opinions I value, and as a consequence I looked forward to finally seeing "Sweet Smell of Success" for quite some time. It does have nice cinematography, and an engaging jazz score by Elmer Bernstein, but otherwise it was quite a dissapointment. You will see reviews referring to the supposedly tart, witty dialogue, both here and professionally-- but don't believe them. Burt Lancaster tells Tony Curtis "I wouldn't wanna take a bite out of you, you're a cookie full of arsenic." a girl that Curtis pressures to have sex with an associate for his benefit tells him, "I'm not a bowl of fruit; you can't just peel me like an orange any time you like." And so on. After a certain point the cleverness, as opposed to the wit, of the writing reaches a level of oversaturation, and the constantly metaphorical dialogue becomes irritatingly arch, the mark of the writers showing off. Lehman and Odets probably could've used collaborators that would rein in their excesses rather than magnify them. Odets is much better in "Rocket to the Moon", which is more sentimental than witty, and Lehman's wit is better for being restrained in "North by Northwest." A friend of mine once told me that he disliked "American Beauty" because by attacking the American suburbs for being far less wholesome than they may wish to seem it was "shooting fish in a barrel", taking smug potshots at subject matter that's ripe for criticism. I haven't made up my mind what I think of that critique of AB, but I see "Sweet Smell of Success" in much the same way-- it takes snide, sophomoric easy shots at publicity peddlers-- what, are we supposed to be shocked to see people in that millieu portrayed as back-stabbing and venal? 
A11259BWFMC5I9 B0002XX87W July 28, 2005 0 0 5.0 Tom Ryan is always an entertaining read. Tom Ryan's work can be found here on americanhitnetwork and over on shaddupandlisten.com where he posts blog entries and podcasts from his weekly radio show. All of his stuff is a lot of fun to read and he always finds a way to introduce me to new music and tell me something I didn't know. 
A11259BWFMC5I9 B000006OQR November 14, 2002 1 1 4.0 Great, quirky pop oddity I can't explain it, but this album is great. It's not the writing, it's not the musicianship... it's something else. Imagine if you crossed David Byrne with Abba, and stirred in a generous helping of the Cranberries. You'd get sort of an odd, latin-influenced, poppy-melodic, guitar-oriented confection. I'm really digging this CD. It has kind of a kitschy quality, so I don't know how it will hold up over time, but I've been listening to it non-stop for a week now. 
A11259BWFMC5I9 B0000033ZG April 23, 2002 1 1 4.0 Good Sampling Every now and then I need to find some new bands, and this album was just the thing. Lot's of great bands. I've found a bunch of new favorites in here and picked up a bunch of new CDs based on this album. If you are bored of your current music collection and are looking for some new CDs to add to your collection, then buy this CD. 
A1136VLB1UJ8CZ B000BH2WF8 December 17, 2005 2 3 5.0 Its here WrestleMania is finally here. I been waiting years for this, because i lost all my old tapes. The first 6 are great after that it got corny. Its good to see the greatest match of all time Hulk Hogan Vs Andre the giant. Now lets get the old Survivor Series, Royal Rumble and Summerslams. 
A1136VLB1UJ8CZ B000AAVZ36 July 21, 2005 0 2 5.0 RDDDDDDD2 truley amazing album. this guy shoul be producing for the top rap stars. just take a listen 
A1136VLB1UJ8CZ B00006HBUJ April 15, 2005 6 10 2.0 One Big Cartoon of a Movie The main problem with Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones is the special effects. The actors look lost and confused most of the time because they are constantly behind blue screens. The end battle looks like a cartoon, it looked like the actors were trapped in Toy Story world. Another problem is the script, it is really lame, with lines like " Sand is corse, but not like you, you are everything soft." its corny lines like this that make some scences laughable. George lucas is probly the laziest dirctor of all time. This film was not directed by George lucas it was directed by the good guys ofI.L.M Cause this movie is one big special effect. Its sad to hear John Williams legendary score over this waste of a Star Wars film. I hope Lucas trys a little harder with episode 3. Actually i pray. 
A113DGKW0JQ64J B00004TDUG March 6, 2006 1 1 5.0 Yes! Exactly what you want to hear from Mr. Bonnet Even though I understand this album to be a rerecording with Graham Bonnett taking over the vocal chores, It's exactly what I want to hear and nearly as strong as his best work from the "Built To Destroy" era. Fantastic melodic metal in the Schenker/Rainbow vein, does Graham find these bands or do they find him? They all seem to share the same great musical sensibilities no matter who he plays with. 
A113DGKW0JQ64J 0743238451 April 5, 2003 2 2 5.0 This is a little too real! Although the book's format reminded me of those great "5 minute detective"-type multiple-path books I read as a kid, what hit me so hard is that, having been to TJ (when I was about the age of the protagonists) is how spot-on it is. The surreal palette of trouble that happy-go-lucky Gringos can wind up in is portrayed with such... accurate humor, can only attest to the fact that the Zuckermans have probably made this trek more often than they want to admit! Tijuana was the perfect first choice to start off this series - but having done so, what could possibly match it? 
A113DGKW0JQ64J B00005A46T September 24, 2001 0 2 2.0 Drums Great. Packaging Good. Songs Bad. I couldn't resist picking up Iowa after being exposed to just so much endless hype about this band - even in Japan! C'mon - is this really anything more than GWAR with Cannibal Corpse lyrics? If you've heard one death metal band with cookie-monster vocals you've heard 'em all, really. It's tight, and well recorded, but who cares? There is nothing new here. Maybe I'm missing something, but this 9-member band sounds like 4 guys, max. 
A113DGKW0JQ64J B000001092 April 29, 2001 0 0 4.0 Top notch, but so familiar! These guys have heavily enough from the early Yngwie Malmsteen library of backing track riffs that you keep thinking "Where have I heard this before?" all the while tapping your foot in the car and singing along. It's almost like Rising Force meets the Scorpions, and that's a very good thing indeed. Well mixed and played, with top-notch production. 
A113DGKW0JQ64J 0879305665 May 17, 2000 6 9 5.0 A mix of subjects you'll see nowhere else This book is a tailor-made introduction for audio DSP-centric Windows programmers. Never have I found such a contemporary mix of subjects addressed, (many with source) in such friendly manner. This book isn't enough to learn DSP from scratch, but it is enough to provide you with at least a cookbook understanding in many areas. And for advanced DSP heads, some subjects covered (tube distortion, noise reduction, compression) are rarely discussed elsewhere. Doug has a rich hardware background as well, and the mentor-ish background he gives is a hoot. Buy it, read it, and orient yourself to new possibilities. Wish I had this useful/friendly/practical an overview back in grad school. 
A113KA21MQG9W4 0198501455 April 17, 2005 2 2 5.0 Definitive guide to birds of New Zealand... And I'm quite sure any Kiwi birder would agree with that. My review is of the revised edition of this book [ISBN 0670-89370-6]. This most certainly is the most complete guide to the birds of NZ with beautiful and accurate slates. I love its neat layout - slates on the right, description and ID on the left. There are no spill overs so its as simple as that. Where necessary, there are distribution diagrams with a detailed key which makes for very effective guide. Because NZ birds are so unique, you will love the additional Handbook section which introduces the different genuses. This comes after the field guide, at the back of the book. Everything is very detailed and you can tell that this book has been crafted with alot of attention and care. Which must be why this is the only field guide to NZ birds officially endorsed by the Ornithological Society of NZ. A downside may be that it's a little bulky to haul around the field, but using it is such a joy that this short coming is quickly compensated. The book for any self-respecting and serious birder, and an indispensible resource for naturalists or the curious amateur. 
A113KA21MQG9W4 0393315703 November 21, 2003 10 16 4.0 A tedious and strong defence of Dawinism Dawkins has proved himself to be a venerable writer by fragmenting even the tenuous theories that form the construct of Darwinism. He offers some very exciting, novel and at times humorous analogies to the principles of evolution that will allow the reader to delve deeper into Darwin's theories - further understanding the implications and manifestations of concurring with the ideologies, which draws you to question the whole concept of evolution or its intricacies (which Dawkins will ensure you do not ignore). This can do a few things for you: agree further, become puzzled and choose to stick with what you thought before you read his book, or just heck it all because it all sounds rediculous to you. It is likely that if you pick up this book you're either already Darwinian in thought or the opposite, and are looking for statements or whole chapters to rebutt. But whether you're with or against Dawkin's, he will push you to a corner, strap you down with sarcasim and offense (if you disagree with him, because he really doesn't think you should) or give you some positive stroking and nurture your understanding even more - which is highly entertaining. i will not go into the details of his book because that's all part of why you would buy it - to make your own discoveries. This is a throughly enjoyable book that you would like to keep for future references (to antagonise creationists). Dawkins also offers some carefully placed and very apt reflections of some blatently riduculous but proliferate and mostly condoned ideologies of our specicist, passive and conformist society - which you might love or hate, sometimes even though you may be with him most of the time. A scientific and journalistic masterpiece which even Darwin would rise from the grave to throw his two cents. 
A113KA21MQG9W4 0691114943 April 18, 2003 7 7 2.0 Not the book for the serious birder While it is nice to see the birds in the flesh with real-life pictures of them, it is certainly not pratical for use in the field. Some of the pictures are poorly taken and it is highly difficult if not impossible to identify certain birds. Some of the images are back-lit, giving a silhouette of the bird! There is no proper classification and very little info given of the birds - how the juveniles look like, breeding plumage, male/female plumage etc. I suppose it is a good book for the casual birder who would like to know what's chirping outside his apartment window or chalet in the wilderness. It also comes with some interesting information on where to go birding to catch wetland or passerine birds etc. I must commend Strange though for all his efforts into going into the field to capture these pictures - all pictures in the book were taken by Strange - good job Strange! 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B000BDGWIU December 12, 2005 3 4 4.0 SOLID! This 16 year old heartthrob is very talented. I normally listen to a CD about 3 times before I give my review and I must say that Chris Brown will be around for a long time. The production and choice of songs on this album are great. My favorite track on this album is number 3. Chris is at a point where his voice is still maturing and he has pulled it off. I'm also glad that this album is getting lots of promotion. His first single "Run it" started from the bottom of the charts and made its way to number 1. GOOD JOB CHRIS. Also when listening to this album, you're going to hear the fire and determination in Chris' voice which will send him to the top. There's lots of singers in this world but it's only the ones with a purpose behind their voices that will send them to the top. Chris Brown is one of them. 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B00005KCGP March 29, 2004 1 1 1.0 You've got to be kidding. I was so excited when I bought this album. When I heard it, the first thing that came to my mind was, "What the ****?" 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B00006LV77 March 24, 2004 1 1 5.0 Deborah's best!!! I love this CD. It's Deborah's best CD of all. The only thing I hate about this CD is that it didn't get enough promotion. 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B0000BXMZX March 14, 2004 2 2 5.0 Aretha is still wearing the crown!! Aretha is still the Queen. This CD is the bomb and she still got it. Nuff said. 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B000001AAY November 18, 2003 1 1 5.0 TARAL HICKS IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Taral Hicks is one of my favorite actresses and when I first heard that she released a album, I made sure I bought it right away. This girl can really, really, really sing. I heard that she was dropped from Motown records when they were doing some restructuring. One of these record labels needs to sign her because she is really talented. I give this album an A+. I really wish she would drop another album soon. The last time I saw Taral was on a episode of the series "Soul Food" and she did outstanding ofcourse. Taral is the bomb. 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B0007P3582 March 11, 2005 0 0 1.0 I GUESS THEY WOULD GIVE A RECORD DEAL TO ANYONE THESE DAYS. TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have never heard such garbage. Nuff said. 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B000006O7K November 28, 2004 1 1 5.0 GREAT ALBUM Although Xscape doesn't have the powerhouse harmonizing capabilities like En Vogue, these girls prove that they could've compete with the big time girl groups. I haven't heard the first two albums but this I'm sure is the best of all. Some or most of the songs were produced by Jermaine Dupri which I think made a great colaboration. Some artist and producers have great chemistry and I think Jermaine did with Xscape. This is an album where I could listen to every song without fastforwarding to the next track. It's a shame that they've broken up with the record of three platinum albums to their name. Even though they're no more, this album is a must buy. Kandi is the only one that released a solo album after the break up. Latocha's solo album was supposed to be released also but didn't. I'm sure there are so many reasons why this group split, but their voices and their music surely wasn't one of them. Overall, GREAT ALBUM. 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B000002J8S October 21, 2004 4 5 5.0 LOVELY GREAT DEBUT AND VERY NICE CD. NUFF SAID. 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B0000507FU July 9, 2004 0 0 5.0 DA BOMB This is a great album but it didn't sell. I think it's because they changed their style from pop/rock to R&B. This album was produced by Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins and even though the songs sound like all his other productions by different artist, the album is great. 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B000000WEX June 7, 2004 2 3 5.0 ONE OF JANET'S BEST ALBUM. Besides Rhythm Nation, this is Janet's best album. Nuff said. 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B0001EFV2W April 30, 2004 1 4 5.0 JANET IS IT. This is a good album. Nuff said. For the hater named "Gerry" from Fairfax, Va, stop hating on her. You're just jealous because Ms. Jackson is it and you're not. Get over it. She's someone and you're nothing. 
A1143SNKOV0ZIT B00000ADG9 March 31, 2004 0 0 3.0 NOT TO BAD This CD is not to bad. I didn't like it at first but now it's okay. I think she should have done another album though. She doesn't have the best voice in the world but she can sing. She can sing a whole lot better that J. Lo, Britney and Madonna. Overall; not to bad. 
A114IO16WXJ6GS 0060582510 May 13, 2004 20 44 5.0 A Blunt, Passionate, Rallying Cry for Conservatives In "Deliver Us From Evil", Sean Hannity reminds people that evil truly exists, and that invoking the notion of evil is responsible, rather than immature. He cites several potent examples of evil, from Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin, to Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. These monsters can only be described as evil. President Bush has issued a pledge, through the Bush Doctrine of 2002, to take the War on Terror to the enemy before he targets us - much in the spirit that Ronald Reagan forcefully created the conditions for the dismantlement of the Soviet Union. Bush's doctrine of pre-emption is right for America, and when the threat posed by a rogue state or a terrorist group fully materializes, it will be too late. Sean Hannity brilliantly displays how the Democrats have disreputably played politics with some of the most vital issues concerning American national security. On issues crucial to the American people - Republicans and Democrats - the Democratic Party of today has abandoned its virtuous past, when JFK and Harry Truman were in power, and has become hijacked by the extreme left that puts opportunism and power ahead of national security. Moreover, Hannity explains why all Democratic presidential candidates (from Howard Dean and John Kerry, to Dick Gephardt and Wesley Clark) are unfit to be president (Joe Lieberman is halfway decent though), and contrasts them with the unwavering moral clarity and decisive leadership George W. Bush has offered the American people and the world. Hannity also addresses several present dangers facing America, from the Syrian Ba'ath party and Iran's mullahs, to Kim Jong-Il's North Korea and China. Sean Hannity has written a powerful and convincing book on how appeasement is fruitless and only leads to more violence, and how there are those who engage in such immoral acts that they have to be classified as evil. With the election in a few months, I believe all Americans should read this book, as it proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that George W. Bush is the right man for another four years. P.S. YES THERE ARE CONSERVATIVES IN CANADA!!! LOL BUSH-CHENEY 2004!!!!! 
A114IO16WXJ6GS 0671722727 February 13, 2004 2 22 2.0 Another Macbeth Average, mediocre play. Boring, tedious, and grim plot, with an unoriginal cast of characters. I don't really recommed it. 
A114IO16WXJ6GS 0671018795 February 8, 2004 0 0 5.0 Awesome Novel This is one of the most riveting, action-packed novels ever written! The plot is SO cool - and the storyline is awsome! Great characters and setting. Highly recommend this book! 
A114IO16WXJ6GS 0929093135 February 4, 2004 11 12 5.0 Devastatingly Truthful Account for Revisionist Historians This book is a factual historical account of the events leading up to the current Arab-Israeli conflict. It is actually an indispensable work because it provides us with a historical account of the region that is actually factual, thus dispelling many of the myths perpetrated by anti-Israelis and liberals. Everyone should read it to fully understand the historical context of the tragic conflict to reach a fair conculsion as to whose land Palestine really is. 
A115DR4OEZIHCK B00005KB74 July 23, 2001 1 1 5.0 One of the Best DVD-Audio Discs - A Reference Standard Wow! "Inside the Music : New Wave" is a really impressive DVD-Audio disc. The DVD-Audio disc from the Silverline label features eleven songs from the late 70s through the mid-80s - the New Wave era of music. The songs are from the Chrysalis, Capitol, EMI and (for the first time on DVD-Audio) I.R.S. labels. The songs are all released through the EMI-Capitol Music Special Markets program. Songs are presented in 5.1-channel 96-kHz 24-bit PPCM in DVD-Audio mode. 5.1-channel mixes are also available in DTS and Dolby Digital for playing on a DVD-Video player. The disc will not play on a CD player (naturally). These mixes are outstanding. The balances between the channels are excellent throughout as is the equalization between the bass and treble. These were problems with earlier "Inside the Music" releases. The LFE levels match exactly with my sound meters and my ears. I believe this shows how much the DVD-Audio mastering process has matured in the approximate six months difference between the release of "Inside the Music : Classic Rock" and the release of "Inside the Music : New Wave". It is also the first edition of Inside the Music where Panasonic did the DVD-Audio mastering. All of the songs are outstanding, so it is hard to pick the stand-outs. "Eyes Without a Face" by Billy Idol uses a mix that puts Billy singing about four feet in front of the listener with extremely clear vocals. "Mexican Radio" by Wall of Voodoo sounds like it was always intended for 5.1-channel sound. "My Sharona" by the Knack has bass like it was always intended to have. All vocals are extremely clean with warm bass - just like had been promised when DVD-Audio appeared late last year. The small negatives mostly have to do with the DVD-Audio format rather than the disc. It still takes too long from a DVD-Audio disc to start playing music even with the Pioneer Elite DV-38A, which skips the menu information and label advertisement. It is also disconcerting that after each track the disc is programmed for the player to reload its play buffer. This leads to way too much time between tracks. The video content consists of some tired still images that are sometimes duplicated from previous "Inside the Music" editions. I'd rather have had the lyrics for those rare times when I actually look at the video content. But all these are very minor criticisms. The music and the mixes are excellent! The best hope for DVD-Audio would be if each DVD-Audio producer would listen to "Inside the Music : New Wave" and emulate these mixes. Certainly the Warner Music DVD-Audio releases could benefit from emlating the LFE levels in New Wave. It would also be nice if the Silverline label would fix the earlier Inside the Music releases to match the sound of "New Wave". In summary this disc may be the best non-orchestral DVD-Audio disc available. It is certainly the disc I will use to demonstrate DVD-Audio's capabilities. The disc could not be more highly recommended. 
A115NFAHJQA6GL B00000IWNG May 19, 1999 6 6 5.0 You can definitely judge this disc by its cover... Its too bad Amazon doesn't have a cover picture up for this one yet, 'cause the portrait of Joe, Amelia & Shortstuff in the cotton field just about perfectly captures what's in store on the disc. Talk about a motherlode of Mississippi country blues! The biggest wonder is why this treasure trove stayed on the shelf so long. Sure its got some blemishes: missed cues, loose strings, etc. & but these warts add, rather than subtract from the end result. Ol' Big Joe kept fine company & the raw, unadorned sound of these sides proves it. Highlights include Joe's blistering acoustic slide fireworks throughout & Amelia Johnson's gutsy blues shouts (there are also tunes fronted by idiosyncratic unknowns such as Austen Pete, "Shortstuff" Macon & Glover Lee Conner). A further, but welcome mystery is Chris Stratchwitz's decision to release the disc in Arhoolie's mid-price series. 26 tracks=77 minutes, you ain't gonna find a better bargain...an essential purchase & one of the best blues releases of the year! 
A1160ZX08NCGRP 0316710628 February 28, 2005 4 4 2.0 Honeymoon Ends in Divorce Is James Patterson losing his ability to write a novel? Is that why he had "help" on this one? If so, the "help" didn't do him any favors. This book was awful. It was juvenile. It jumped from character to character without much chohesiveness. It was just a really bad book. Save your money and get it from the library. 
A1160ZX08NCGRP 0399150897 November 3, 2003 5 5 1.0 Bad, Bad Blow Fly I have read every Cornwell book written and was looking forward to reading Blow Fly. This book was a huge disappointment. Thankfully I got it from my library and didn't waste any money on it. It was written in the first person, which didn't work well. Each chapter was a different character - so it jumped around constantly. The plot was very weak. And the ending was so anti-climactic that she wrapped it up in the last 15 pages. It felt like she got sick of writing the book and just came up with whatever she could to end it. Maybe she was too busy researching Princess Diana's death for her TV appearance to spend much time on this book. It was definitely a half-hearted effort. If you're a staunch Cornwell fan, you'll read it - but don't waste your money on buying it - go to your library. 
A116C0JXYOM5L6 0275948706 April 12, 2003 33 46 5.0 Unbiased scholarship Judaism, like any culture, has at times been insular and ethnocentric in its pursuits. There is nothing surprising about this fact. MacDonald, in my opinion, does an excellent job in presenting unbiased facts. Since facts, viewed in their entirety, are not always flattering (again, as would be the case with any culture) some would like to dismiss them as anti-Semitic. This is preposterous. MacDonald meticulously takes you through the history of the Jews and provides quotes from notables and facts of that time, both pro and con. At various times Jews have been treated harshly. Why would anyone NOT want to try to understand how and why this happened, in hopes that it would never happen again? To simply say he is at times quoting some people who said less than flattering things about certain Jews at certain times, is to bury your head in the sand. I can only say, read the book and draw your own conclusions. Don't let someone else tell you how you should think. 
A116OZ4XIDQYRI B00009ENKW June 26, 2003 19 19 4.0 Great Juicer! This juicer has been great. It juices anything we throw at it. Very powerful motor. Very little vibration. Super high quality! We've made all kinds of juices, but especially like vegetable (beets, carrots, etc.) and fruit (cherries, strawberries, etc.) mixes. The only drawback I've found is that the basket that holds the pulp is a little hard to clean. It's not as bad as it could be, but does require a bit of time to get all the pulp out. We've found that a vegetable (stiff bristled) brush makes this go a lot faster. I didn't rate it 5 stars because of that (somewhat hard to clean) and also that the capacity of juicing is smaller than what some people might need. I suspect you could get about 2, maybe 3 cups of juice before having to remove the pulp. If you wanted more you could just start over. I can imagine for some people (or commercial operations) this would be a drawback. If I were to get another juicer, I'd definitely buy an Omega. The quality surpasses others I have seen. 
A116RQ5KN4W1H 0877797099 August 23, 2001 12 30 1.0 Maudlin and Trite This "dictionary" is the very epitome of bad taste and misinformed poppycock. Why on Earth do I need to see a picture of a dog (page 794--Norwegian elkhound) yet there is no picture of novaculite. The definition of novaculite is so inaccurate as to boggle the mind. The "dictionary" has "a very hard fine-grained siliceous rock..." When any geologist worth his salt knows that novaculite is only a mildly hard, moderately grained rock of SEDIMENTARY origin, NOT siliceous origin. Inaccuracies abound in this horribly written tricksy tome. I suggest instead using the New World Dictionary instead. 
A116RQ5KN4W1H 0789410516 January 17, 2001 9 10 3.0 The Modern Pilgrims Travel Guide One of my top things to do on my "fantasy list" is to visit every sacred site listed in this informative book. I love the lay-out and ease of use of most "DK" books. This book is particularly interesting in that it gives a fairly decent summary of each holy site. It is a good beginning guide and may help to "spur" interest in a particular area that you can then delve more deeply into at a later time. However, I thought they could have given a bit more information on some of the English sites. They also tended to focus mainly on pagan sites. 
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B00004XRBM March 5, 2003 1 1 5.0 Still one of the best games I've ever played. System Shock 2 is hard to categorize, because it blends several genres and styles of games so well. It's a Role-Playing First-Person Shooter Science Fiction Survival/Horror game, with some extra twists here and there. If you wished Half-Life was more like Deus Ex, or you wanted to play the more violent and scary parts of Thief with 22nd century firepower, this is the game you want to play. Though it's getting a bit dated now, this game was far enough ahead of its time to still be very playable. Where the original System Shock made history as a remarkably immersive story-driven first-person shooter, the sequel goes even further with complex character development elements usually only seen in role-playing games. The graphics scale up smoothly enough to still look impressive on today's faster, higher resolution (and higher polygon count) displays, the sound is of sufficient quality to still be just as effective as most newer, more technically advanced productions, and of course, a great story is never obsolete. Once you get into a game this immersive, you forget about the technical details that may no longer be as cutting-edge as they once were. Just turn off the lights, plug in your headphones (or surround-sound if you have it), and try to stay alive. If you happen to forget that it's just a game, this one can really scare you. Definitely not for the faint of heart. The biggest flaw in this game is that the developers just didn't have enough time to fully flesh-out and polish some of the later parts. Certain areas are just less expansive and detailed and finely-tuned than others. The game doesn't significantly suffer from what's missing. It just could have been that much better. By far the most common complaint about this game is that the weapons break too fast. Personally, I don't consider that a flaw. I like the extra stress factor of having to keep an eye on the condition of my weapons. Unlike most First-Person Shooters, your resources are very limited in this game. Throughout most of the game, you will very rarely have enough ammo to stop worrying about making every shot count. There are a limited number of weapons available, and if you keep firing one until it jams, you have to either expend other resources to fix it or deal with the fact that you have one less gun to work with. If you really don't like worrying about broken weapons, there is a way to reduce or completely disable weapon deterioration. It's not a menu option you can switch on and off within the game, but the release notes file on the CD explains how to do it, and it's not difficult. One complaint I've heard about the end of this game is that there are two "final battles" at the end, and the second one is disappointingly easy. I didn't feel that way because I recognized that the first final battle was the climax, and then when there was one more confrontation after that, I thought of it as more of an epilogue than a challenge. This is something gamers just aren't used to, and the only other game I've played that had an "epilogue" after the final confrontation was Half-Life, which has been accused of having the worst ending of any game ever. The ending of System Shock 2 isn't nearly that bad, but it can be disappointing if the relatively short final areas have left you expecting more. Unfortunately, due to the particular circumstances of the closing of the company that developed the game, Looking Glass Studios, it is very unlikely that there will ever be a third System Shock game. 
A117GJYXI844FX B00006IJJC January 7, 2004 2 2 4.0 Progressive Scan This game can be played as a 4-way vs fighting game which is pretty unique as most are limited to 2 players. Another feature of this game is that it can output in 480p progressive scan (just hold down B when the cube appears on the screen during the system boot) even though it doesn't say it's progressive scan capable on the case. 
A117L29JBUWK5U B0002ZAILY April 8, 2005 6 8 5.0 Try It. You'll Like It. I haven't been good about keeping up with the latest trends in portable electronics over the years, but my Sony Discman (manufactured 1993) is finally starting to die on me so I decided to see what this iPod craze is all about and get my feet wet with Apple's most introductory model: the iPod Shuffle 512mb. I must say, I am an instant convert. Every aspect of the design of this player displays the seamlessness and perfection that can only result from thousands of hours of product research. It is a small, unassuming piece of plastic that essentially has controls for play, skip, volume and manages to play 10 times as many songs as my old 2-pound Sony, which will be sorely missed by the way. My earbud headphones come in a plastic case that takes up twice as much space as the actual player. And, of course, the most important part: the sound quality is incredible. I am just floored by how great the music sounds. The true test of time will be if this thing is with me as long as the Sony (probably not since it uses an irreplaceable rechargeable battery). Don't waste your time with any other brand of MP3 player. Apple has cornered the market by staying ahead of the pack in terms of storage capacity, innovative design and reasonable pricing. You just can't mess with perfection. 
A117L29JBUWK5U 067977548X July 30, 2002 2 2 5.0 Perceptive & Poignant. James Gleick's Faster is well written, and even though the things he says may not be what some want to hear, his claims are all backed up with facts. This book was written in 1999, and so far things are unfolding just as he claims they will, ever faster. Sometimes he dawdles over certain points for too long and seems like an old crank, but the emphasis is necessary. He makes a several references to how people will continually push the elevator door close button to shave seconds off their wait. No longer are there elevator operators, they took too up too much time by being polite. If you feel like you never have enough hours in the day, even though modern conveniences should be giving us more free time, then this is a book you should read. The pace of the writing emphasizes the theme of this book as he jumps from topic to topic trying to cover as much as possible without losing your attention. As a society we are a Type-A personality, always trying to get things faster, whatever that may cost us in the long run. 
A1182D16IW3ML7 0786015020 May 8, 2006 0 0 5.0 Excellent biographical analyses of eleven murderers . Joel Norris, Ph.D. has presented indepth biographies and intelligent commentaries on eleven people who committed multiple murders, including George Jo Hennard Jr., the son of an armed forces orthopedic surgeon, who drove his pick-up truck into a Luby's Cafeteria in Texas; Daniel Rakowitz, the son of a Texas deputy sheriff, who chopped up his female roommate in their Lower East Side New York apartment; Vietnam Veteran Arthur Shawcross, the mild-mannered man who loved his wife, yet killed prostitutes; and Laurie Wasserman, the disturbed daughter of an Illinois businessman. Norris's commentaries on the cause of anti-social behavior are a valuable contribution to the fields of behavioral science and criminal justice. Highly recommended reading for any student of human behavior and for anyone working in the fields of mental health and criminal justice. 
A1182D16IW3ML7 0816026653 September 6, 2004 1 4 5.0 An Indispensable Encyclopedia of Nutrition . I decided to take charge of my own life and become my own physician, after having been victimized for years by ruthless, incompetent professionals, most of whom did me more harm than good. Although I have suffered what may very well be irreversible nerve damage as a result of "mood-stabilizers" WRONGLY prescribed to me by VA physicians and UCLA professor/physicians, I have since found that by applying the principles of sound nutrition one can prevent disease, both physical and mental, and HOPEFULLY restore one's health, both PHYSICAL and MENTAL. What I have discovered is that prescribed mood-stabilizers, antidepressants and neurolpetic drugs do NOT stabilize the nervous system, they DESTROY the nervous system, the immune system and the cardiovascular system, a condition now recognized as Neuroleptic Induced Deficit Syndrome (NIDS). I now realize that those physicians who prescribed the drugs that nearly killed me were not even TRYING to help me. They were intentionally exploiting me and slowly killing me (and others, no doubt) for their own financial gain! Author Ronzio's 30 year career as a biochemist and his professional writing skills have made Encyclopedia of Nutrition & Good Health an easy-to-read, comprehensive and indispensabe reference book (all 486 pages) for understanding the biochemistry of the human body and the principles of sound nutrition. Nutritious food and regular mental/physical exercise, not prescription drugs, is in my opinion the ONLY way to achieve sound mental and physical health. I was able to obtain an excellent used copy of this book at a reasonable price from Amazon.com, even though the book is listed as "unavailable." 
A1182D16IW3ML7 B00006AUMZ January 2, 2004 2 4 5.0 Brilliant Film! - "Frailty" is one of the best modern-day gothic/horror films ever made! If you like Poe-style drama in a modern-day Texas setting, you'll like this one. Suspense all the way! One twist after another. Bill Paxton displays his brilliance as a director and actor. Luke Askew, Jeremy Sumpter, Matt O'Leary, Matt McConaughey and Powers Booth are equally brilliant as a superb supporting cast of characters. I've viewed the film a dozen times so far, and each time I view it I realize more and more what a craft of genius this film truly is! And a budget film at that! For anyone interested in writing, directing or acting, this is one to study. Or for anyone just looking for escape! 
A118BIL281FJ29 0374512973 February 26, 2006 1 1 5.0 Like the fruit itself, delicious For twenty years I have given this book to recent high school graduates, carefully inscribing each book to encourage them to see what McPhee reveals here. What he reveals most vividly is the idea that there is no such thing as an uninteresting subject; there is only an uninterested reader. What also impressed me, decades ago, was the notion of connectedness, and the idea that one thing-an orange, a diamond, iron, oil, lead-could reveal everything about our world. Finally, he deserves five stars because he never gets in the way of his subject, and he has moments of such brilliance-his devotional to Otto, the restauranteur, still ranks as a great moment in writing, fiction or non-that everyone should read him. My favorite of a shelfull of McPhees, with the Headmaster in a virtual dead heat. 
A118BIL281FJ29 0446520942 September 27, 2001 7 7 5.0 From the author First, I want to thank so many of your for your kind words, both here and to me directly. The response has been very gratifying. The style and approach of the book were chosen deliberately, and while they seem to satisfy almost everyone, they don't delight everyone. That is to be expected. I wanted a book that people would read and respond to, and that might affect their behavior. This was the best way I knew how, and the responses suggest that if it wasn't the best possible choice, it was a good choice. Thanks. The best is yet to come, by the way, next September--I am convinced of it. One final word, to the reviewer who assumed I could not have meant "pervasive" or "synecdoche" in my discussion of stories. I did mean that the use of this device is pervasive rather than persuasive--the device isn't intended to persuade anyone, but it is very widely used, and therefore "pervasive." And I did mean "synecdoche" rather than "anecdote," as the reviewer suggests, for the reasons I mention in the text. Synecdoche refers, among many writers, to the technique of illustrating a larger point with a smaller, specific story. My books are more often criticized for appearing too simple and down-to-earth rather than too complex or ethereal. In this case, I appear to have confused at least this reviewer, and I try to avoid this. Again, I am delighted that so many of you appear to have benefitted from this book. I certainly have; oddly enough, its words constantly remind me of what I must do to attract and keep customers. Just as oddly, this advice seems to help me immensely. Best wishes to you all, dissenters included, Harry Beckwith 
A118DD1BQQX1WX 0865476624 January 4, 2005 7 7 5.0 Lays the ground work for a strong Ashtanga practice I found this book to be an excellent source on both the philosophy of Ashtanga yoga as well as a great how to of moving from one asana to the next in the Primary Series. Do not buy this book if you are trying to learn the Primary Series from a book. Although the level of detail in this book is great, Ashtanga is better learn watching/learning from a live person, or if you are really pressed for money and/or do not have an Ashtanga teacher near you get a good video (David Swenson, Richard Freeman, John Scott, and others have excellent tapes out). With that said, this book is a wonderful reference tool and offers exact breath counts. In Ashtanga, every movement is associated with a breath, this book provides information on how to get in and out of every posture in the primary series following the breath (i.e. how many inhalations and exhalations should be accomplished moving between postures). This book also offers great detail as it relates to living the yoga you practice. While I may not agree with Jois' entire philosophy, it is a great deal of knowledge to be gained from this book. This book is a must read if you are an Ashtanga practioner or teacher. This book will help you deepen your practice both physically and spiritually. I would also suggest this book for anyone curious about the philosophy of Ashtanga yoga. 
A118DD1BQQX1WX B0000DBJBD February 9, 2004 8 8 5.0 Wow! This woman is no joke. I tried this workout because it got some great ratings. I can now see why. This work out is not for the faint of heart. In fact, I would say that the overall workout is on par or maybe a step below a primary series (ashtanga) workout. The poses themselves are not beyond the experienced beginner level. However, it is what she does with them that makes the workout intermediate to advanced. She will perform a given pose repeatedly in regular speed, and then in super slow motion. It is this super slow motion that really builds strength and endurance, because you just can't know how to perform the pose, but you have to be able to hold the pose for a while. In addition, the abs section of this work was very challenging for me. Just so that I don't scare off anyone new to yoga who wants to try this DVD, Tari does offer you the option of watching the pose performed first, then you can follow along with either the full or modified version of the pose. This DVD was 60+ minutes of sweat and work. If you are ready for a fairly intense workout then give this a try. 
A118DD1BQQX1WX B00009YXBK October 24, 2003 17 18 4.0 Good workout, but it does have flaws I agree with a previous viewer in the fact that the warmup is hurried, and the positions aren't held very long, and the corpse pose is not held very long either. However, I would not go so far as to say that this isn't yoga. If you are the type of person who is very much into the spirtual side of yoga, and a slower pace with your yoga, don't bother. Besides did you REALLY expect spirtuality from a MTV ;-)? I have been practising yoga a few years now, and I found the video challenging and fun. There are some ashtanga-like aspects to the flow (kinda like an ashtanga-lite, for those who are not quite ready for the entire Primary Series :-)). Once you get past the hurried sun-salutations, the workout gets better. I particularly liked the balance and seated poses. I especially liked the variation with beginner, intermediate and advanced versions of poses. It gave me either modifications, or a way to deepen the pose. Some of the poses Kristin does can be found in the Primary Series of Ashtanga yoga (i.e. triangle, reverse-triangle, most of the seated stretching series, jumping in and out of poses, etc.). The Pilates at the end of the tape is not bad either, a good way to work on abs after a fairly intense 45 minutes. However, I don't think Windsor and other pilates gurus have much to worry about from Kristin as a pilates instructor. Overall, this a solid yoga tape for a person with experience. The level of the workout does assume you know a certain amount of yoga. I would suggest this tape/dvd to any intermediate/advanced student looking for an Ashtanga-like workout. 
A118DD1BQQX1WX 0060927267 June 19, 2001 2 2 5.0 A great super natural thriller I thought Due's book was fantastic. This is the first work of hers that I have read, but it certainly will not be the last. The book features Hilton James, who suffers from nightmares. He almost drowned at age 8, but was fortunately rescued by his grandmother "Nanna", who dies in her rescuing of Hilton. Although Hilton survives, his psyche becomes progrssively damaged with each occurence of these nightmares. They go away for a while (5 years), but come back when his wife DeDe (a newly elected District Court Judge) starts receiving death threats from a white racist. Hilton begins having trouble distinguishing his "dreams" from reality as the two start to meld together. This was an eerrie, thrilling tale that kept me interested throughout the entire book. If you enjoy super natural thrillers, then this one is a must read. 
A118DD1BQQX1WX 0072121203 September 13, 2000 6 11 3.0 A little too basic if you have any Oracle background at all I thought that this book was O.K. Unfortunately, I ended up taking it back because it wasn't quite what I needed. I would suggest this book to anyone who has absolutely no clue about being a DBA or Oracle8.x. The first 100 or so pages are dedicated to providing the reader insight into the world of database administration. This book gives some worthwile information on db setup, and not as much specific information as I would like to see on the actual job(s) that a dba does. My suggestion is to combine this book with another (Oracle8i DBA reference or Oracle8i reference). Overall, this book gives decent elementary knowledge of the world of Oracle, but unless you are a complete novice to Oracle/dba buy another book, or look for something more intermediate. 
A118FFG5EFOTUV B00096S3PY January 30, 2006 8 25 1.0 Even Deaf People Think She Sucks Let's bring on the unhelpful votes, since there's alot of people that think this garbage is good. First off Mary J she isn't, first off Mary had producers and writers who gave her material that she could work with. In her early years, she never covered anything she couldn't handled and was allowed to grow as the years went by. Mary brought raw emotion and attitude to tracks in a way the music world didn't see before, and that's why we love her till this day. I see none of that in Keysha Cole, none whatsoever, this girl flat out sucks, and that's being nice. After listening to "I Should Of Cheated", I felt cheated out of my money and the four minutes of my life I'll never see again. The torture reached a climax when "I Found You" blasted, unfortunately found my ears. Hearing her voice cracking and all, made being deaf sound a little pleasant, where's Simon when you need him. This girl can not sing, she makes Total sound like En Vogue, Ashanti sound like Aretha Franklin, and Mya sound like Patti LaBelle. Soon as her voice comes on the radio, the dog start howling. The sad thing is, we'll have to endure her for another year or two. If I had my way and saw this chick in concert, I'd have a bullhorn and tell her to shut up. And no, acting ghetto and dressing in what Foxy Brown and Lil Kim tossed out the window isn't sexy, is downright slutty. Sane people take a pass on this please, don't insult your intelligence. 
A118FFG5EFOTUV B0006B2AFQ March 1, 2005 1 1 4.0 Nas proves to still be one of Hip Hop's Finest!!!!! After experencing somewhat of a letdown from God's Son, I kind of felt Nas had to come back with a more solid album. He did just that. Eventhough it's a double disc, I wasn't really preparing for a blow away rhyme sessions like Illmatic or Lost Tapes, but Street Disciple, in my opinion, is a solid album worth buying. Lyrically, Nas, as always, is on point. One thing we never have to worry about, is Nas as a lyricists. Nothing mind blowing like say Illmatic or Stillmatic, but the usual delivery we expect. The guest emcee's hold their own with Nas for a change, unlike previous albums. On "Just A Moment", guest Quan manages not to hold his own and not be drown out by Nas, much like say AZ on previous albums. Scarlett drops by on "Sekou Story" and "Live Now", she shines brighter on "Live Now", with a haunting verse as a woman on her death bed dying of AIDS, recalling her past sins. She brings more depth to this song, than Foxy Brown did on "It Was Written" and The Firm joint. Speaking of guest spots, Maxwell drops by on "No One Else In The Room", this one suprised me, the notion of these two on one song sounds like a train wreck, but after listening to it, it's one of the best tracks on the second disc. Of course Olu Dara, Nas' dad, guest spot on "Bridging The Gap" topped them all. Production wise was way better than God's Son, which was kind of the drawback on that album. Gems on the album include, "These Are Our Hero's", where Nas blasts black celebs reppin for all the wrong things, "Remember The Times", where Nas reminisces about ex-girls he would hit, if wifey gave him a pass to cheat, and "Getting Married", which is obviously about his wife Kelis. I am satisfied giving it four. I love this CD, some tracks haven't clicked with me yet, such as "Virgo", where the collab with Ludacris and Doug E Fresh was a miss, the ode to Rakim, while nice, was another miss (should of mentioned more). That's small though, five would put this with "Illmatic", which states it's one of Hip Hop's greatest albums, which Street Disciple isn't. So four stars. This is a definite go getter for hardcore Nas fans and hardcore hip hop heads alike. 
A118FFG5EFOTUV 0743456912 July 25, 2004 6 11 2.0 WWE Hype Machine At It's Worst This book had promise, then Vinny Mac and crew had to work their way into it. In all, the book is not a bad read, there were just some parts that baffled me to death. The nerve of Flair to bash the likes of Savage, Bret Hart, and Foley to name a few is puzzling. He could of stated he didn't like neither style, but he went on to trash their accomplishments in the business, that's classless and unlike the Flair I watched and read about. It gets better, the talk of veterans needing to put younger guys over, but then praising long time politicians like Undertaker, Triple H, and Shawn Michaels, guys who would rather pass kidney stones and cancer tumors, than put anyone else over. That's when you can tell, it's the WWE spin machine. In conclusion, it's up to you if you want to purchase, but beware, alot of wacky WWE spin is on display. The stories of the old days are worth the buy, I will admit! 
A118GK08650JY7 B0007Y79B2 September 20, 2005 5 7 5.0 CLOSE TO PERFECTION WOW! Everyone who has seen my black 4G ipod has ordered one, even those who hated ipods for no reason. This is an amazing engineering feat, I have no idea how they fit all that in to a player the size of a credit card. It's got a beautiful color screen, syncs with your outlook contacts and calendar, stores photos, games, clocks, and best of all it's got iTunes. I really don;t see how they could improve on this besides maybe getting a protective coating on the black nano. It does scratch real easy. And contraty to what was posted, you can get 2 lines of free laser engraving when you order from the apple store online. Also, the battery lasts plenty 14 hours, who wants to carry around bulky AAA batteries around all the time. I think the competition might just have to close shop pretty soon. 
A118GK08650JY7 B000089RV5 April 15, 2003 1 16 5.0 Superb effort from Lucinda Brilliant, way better than anything you will come out this year, so what are u waiting for? 
A118GK08650JY7 B00006JJ3Q November 14, 2002 0 0 5.0 One of the best singer-songwriters of the pop era I would rate Joni Mitchell, Lucinda Williams and Ron Sexsmith as the top 3 songwriters of the past 30 years, if not 50. It took a little while for me to grow into his groove but once I got there, I was totally hooked. Beautiful melodies ala early Paul McCartney, senstive lyrics think Paul Simon, it boggles my mind that Ron is not a much bigger name. As to his reference to religion in the latest album, I think it was his response to Sep 11 and was in no way condescending. I first heard of Ron through Lucinda William's Starbucks Personal Choices CD and this is my first exciting discovery in quite a few years, the last being Lucinda a few years back. I am going to see Ron perform at Joe's Pub in the Public Theatre NYC tonight and I can't wait! 
A118J6LU4OJFV3 1558538356 November 22, 2001 5 6 5.0 How to Live a Happy and Rewarding Life With its pretty plaid exterior and easily read pages, this little book packed full of wisdom is perfect for most coffee tables. What an excellent gift! I treasure my copy of LIFE'S LITTLE INSTRUCTION BOOK. Jane Riley, author of SOLOMON'S PORCH 
A118J6LU4OJFV3 1582550549 October 13, 2001 19 20 3.0 Too Much About Products The sparse information in WOUND CARE about caring for wounds and preventing them is superb, but the manual is primarily a catalogue of products. The type of material provided in WOUND CARE can be found in the detail sheets packed with wound care products. I found the book a disappointment. 
A118J6LU4OJFV3 0929925289 August 6, 2001 6 6 4.0 The Baptism of Howie Cobb The Baptism of Howie Cobb is an enjoyable story about a boy who left Georgia and rode a bus to South Dakota to work in a CCC camp. Howie left Georgia without understanding life, love, romance, or God. Through his adventures, sometimes frightening and sometimes comical but always enjoyable to read, Howie Cobb becomes a man. Dr. Robbins selects details carefully. He has a superior skill with dialogue. It has been said that he is indebted to Steinbeck in his style. He pays careful attention in The Baptism of Howie Cobb to the overall structure of the novel. Particularly noteworthy is his use of the geographical properties of various parts of the United States to develop the plot of the novel. At the same time, he ties the plot and the setting to the rich use of symbolism in the novel. I recommend it for entertaining reading. 
A118K3NR8Y9YJ9 0743244281 June 20, 2003 1 3 4.0 A Fun Book. Worth the few quaters to purchase. Barry Trotter not only pokes fun at the Harry Potter storyline. It also is a social satire for everyone. It angles much of its humor toward a capitalistic society that has to market every aspect of a great idea (like Harry Potter or Barry Trotter). The purpose of Lord Valumart is to make money wherever possible, and he does a great job of it too. Also, the inflection and notes from the author throughout the book are hysterical. I especially loved the last note of the book that pokes fun of post modernism. Oh, and if the reader hates the book, that is fine too. The author was nice enough to have a generic letter of offense at the back that can be photocopied and sent to the publisher that allows the readers to check off why they hate the author. The book receives four stars instead of five because some of the jokes are just beat to death in this book. Perhaps the book should have been shorter. But, then again, the book would then turn into a short story. The book is already only 174 pages long. 
A118K3NR8Y9YJ9 0553297988 March 20, 2003 1 2 3.0 Slow Pace and Characterization Flaws the Book Jedi Search by Kevin J Anderson is the first of book in the Jedi Academy Trilogy. It is in this book that the famed Jedi Academy is recreated by Luke Skywalker. It is unfortunate that the narrative voice and poor characterization slow the pace of a story that has so much potential. First, a poor narrative voice hurts the novel. There is a saying among writers - "Show, Don't Tell." While the story is being shown to the reader, Mr. Anderson unfortunately continuously delves back into the past films and other novels as reference to what is currently occurring. These comparisons, or secondary thoughts, do not help to move the story along. As a matter of fact, it slows the novel down to a very slow pace. The novel is 353 pages long, but when all the unnecessary description is taken out the novel could have been told in 250 pages. What hurts the narrative the most is the constant reference to the Dark Empire comic series. If the reader didn't read the comic series, he or she would be lost for several pages in the book. The narrative voice also is hurt by some of the language that Mr. Anderson uses. One example would be that Lando goes to see a blob race in order to identify a man who could have Jedi Power. When the race begins, the narrative voice calls the blob's racetrack a "Blobstacle Course". I don't know if it was the author's intention to make the reader laugh at the term, but I certainly laughed. Poor characterization is also shown in the book. The dialog in several cases didn't seem natural to the characters. Also, when Leia is confronted with situations, it didn't match her normal reactions. When Han disappeared for a long period of time, she showed no emotion except her inner anger. Han is her husband, and she should have naturally felt worried and would investigated his disappearance sooner. So with all these comments, why was it given 3 stars? Some plot lines and the character of Kyp Durron save the book. If the reader can look past the poor characterization and narrative, the plots of Luke trying to find the students academy, Han caught in the spice Mines of Kessel, and the story of Kyp Durron all help to keep the story alive. Though most of the main characters seemed to be one dimensional, the character of Kyp was far from that. From the first moment he was seen, he showed his potential at being a great character in the Star Wars universe, and I look forward to seeing what happens to him. 
A118K3NR8Y9YJ9 0618002251 July 26, 2001 3 4 5.0 AN EPIC MUST READ MYTH!!!!!!!!! When Tolkien created Middle Earth, he created a new mythology that people would read long after his death. The Lord of the Rings is an inspiration for many modern day writers as well as readers. The culters brought out in the book seem real. The characters are rich. The story is classic. No one can go through life without ever experiencing such a wonderful story. The story is about a hobbit, Frodo, who is given the ONE RING that can destroy all of Middle Earth if it is put into the hands of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron. Now, this simple innocent fellow, who lives in a part of the land where nothing bad ever happens, must travel out into the dark and evil realm of Middle Earth to throw the ring into the fires where it was created. The past converges with the present in order to save the future of their world. The epic war of the ring has begun, and the Halfling must fulfill his quest or all would be lost. If you haven't read the book, there is no time to waste. The movie will be out soon, and books are always better than their film adaptations. 
A118K3NR8Y9YJ9 0553801341 June 7, 2001 1 1 2.0 Could have been a lot shorter I do enjoy Mr. Koontz's work a lot, but FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE was not one of them. The book is a little over 600 pages long, and the story really could have been told in a little over 200 pages. Most of the story did not need to be told. For example, the main antagonist, Cain, is set against the main protagonist, Bartholomew, and the two do not have their conflict until the end of the novel. There was one saving grace to the book, which was why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The saving grace in the novel was the traumatic situation that both Bartholomew and his mother, Agnes Lampion, must face. That situation does make a person think a little differently about how precious life really can be. Still, that situation does not last long in the novel. Hopefully next time Mr. Koontz's next book will be better. 
A1192ZVWRV7HDO 0132543842 January 1, 2001 2 4 2.0 This book needs a good editor I bought this book because I needed to know the material for my work. The material and its extent are good, the only problem I am having is one that is common today. It was written by people who do not have English as their first language. What would make the book alot easier to read and less confusing is the employment of a good English speaking editor to polish the presentation of the ideas. The subject is not so simple that one can forgive arbitrariness in usage of words or phrases to explain the ideas. It is frustrating because I really need to know this material, for my job, and I do not need the extra load of trying to guess what the authors meant to say. The book is important and deserves a good editing job. 
A1192ZVWRV7HDO B00000JHEO July 9, 1999 1 1 5.0 Absolutely Hendrix at his live ultimate I have just about every Hendrix recording that I could get my hands on for the last 29 years. This album is just about the best. There is uncut previously unreleased material that the Hendrix family was kind enough to provide us, his long time fans who crave the sound of his music even to this day. The cuts Jam back at the House, Woodstock Improv, and Villanova Junction are like nothing anyone has ever heard from any other artist. This is an absolute must for anyone who loves the sound of the electric guitar in all its glory. 
A1194XTC0NW6PI B0009PVZ4G October 12, 2005 0 1 5.0 Solid, traditional Dhrupad This is a great recording. There are precious few recordings of Ustad Asad Ali Khan and this one is a solid performance. He meticulously plays each traditionally prescribed phase of the Alaap as demanded by his tradition, a lengthy Tarparan after the main Bandish - this is the part that I love the most in Asad Ali Khan's music - the excellent improvisation with the Pakhawaj. Some tend to do the Tarparan part at the end of the Jhala before the Bandish as Ravi Shankar does on his recording of Raga Puriya Kalyan and Asad Ali Khan plays it after the Bandish. I also want to clarify a point regarding a previous reviewer who seems to think Asad Ali Khan plays the "Sitar Idiom" and not "Rudra Veena Ideal" which is pretty strange since every aspect of the traditional Sitar Alap is a exact replica of the Rudra Veena tradition. If he intends to cast that aspersion on Asad Ali Khan's music, he should mention which aspect of Asad Ali Khan's music is representative of the "Sitar idiom". Also, there is and was no "one Rudra Veena Ideal" ever. There are/were many traditions of Veena playing and Asad Ali Khan is faithful to his tradition which is no less legitimate than Shamsuddin Faridi or anyone else's. The reviewer seemed to have been excessively swayed by the liner notes while not being able to correlate them to the actual performance => the notes that casually mention peripheral influences on the Jaipur Beenkar's tradition and the changes in the construction of the Rudra Veena that were necessitated by the need to give it a lengthier life and better sound quality. 
A1194XTC0NW6PI B000APEWE0 September 15, 2005 0 0 5.0 Simply a masterpiece This is an amazing movie that explores the vanity and ruin of a once-prosperous feudal landlord (Biswambhar Roy) in Bengal around the turn of the century. Roy is a man who can not come to terms with a fast-changing world where his old feudal order is slowly disappearing and he is being upstaged by a vulgar money-lender (Ganguly) upstart whose family were once his beneficiaries and whom he considers beneath contempt for his lack of refinement. Even as he loses all else that he held dear, Roy remains a Zamindar to the end and decides on one last party in his Jalsaghar (music hall) that has remained closed for so long to teach the upstart a lesson. The movie features excellent black-and-white cinematography, great acting and of course, the genius of Ray's direction. To the lovers of music, this movie features a real treasure-trove of music with music direction by the late great Ustad Vilayat Khan, vocals by Akhtari Bai and a rare classic by the late Pakistani singer Salamat Ali Khan who was only 19 when he was recorded for this movie. 
A1194XTC0NW6PI B000006RJV May 18, 2000 2 2 5.0 The grand master of Khyal Arguably the greatest living master of Hindustani classical vocal music. His beautiful rendition of Sadarang's loving plea to his king Muhammad Shah Rangeeley in Raaga Malkauns is amazingly touching. His unforgettably rich voice and imaginative genius at display. 
A119IU67AHNE2W B0000EI9VK December 10, 2004 16 16 3.0 they're ok.. but they look far better than they actually are My primary purpose for getting this headset was for gaming. When I originally bought this pair about a year ago, I paid almost twice as much at Best Buy, which is completely ludicrous for the kind of product this turned out to be. For around $20, it might be an okay value, but I would recommend you look around some more, in case you feel like settling on this. So here's what I thought about the AHS-502... SOUND: I got suckered in by the neat look and packaging of the AHS-502, but don't let its sleek silver appearance or the fact they're calling themselves a "Studio Headset" get your hopes up too much. The sound, overall, is pretty mediocre. Nothing terribly bad, but pretty lackluster. They're adequate for gaming and not so great for music. MIC: The microphone tends to pick up a fair amount of ambient noise, so watch out where your fans are pointed. CONSTRUCTION: The headphones are actually quite sturdy. The same goes for the microphone boom. I've moved the boom thousands of times and it's still attached to my headset with no sign of wear. I've trashed my fair share of headphones, and this one has stayed in one piece. HOWEVER.... the wires are another matter. The only place I used this pair of headphones was strictly for PC gaming, so it pretty much stayed in one place all the time. Given that, the wear on the wires shouldn't have been that extreme, but within about half a year I started having problems with the microphone. It seems that part of the cord near the little volume control pod seems to have broken or lost contact so it wasn't passing my mic signal through. I would have to fidget with the wire in order to get my mic working again. Eventually, my microphone boom became a useless prop. COMFORT: Overall, these weren't too comfortable. They would be okay for short periods of time, but they're definitely not meant to be worn for extended periods of time. I was typically ready for a break after about an hour. Given the lackluster sound, they should have gone for a lighter physical design. And since my primary purpose was for gaming, the lack of comfort was pretty disappointing. FEATURES: The cord has an attached control pod which includes a volume wheel and a 3-position switch for the microphone input volume (low, high, off). PROS: 1) sturdy headset & microphone boom 2) decent value for around $20, but no more than that CONS: 1) flimsy wires killed my mic 2) mediocre sound 3) fair amount of ambient noise via the mic 4) uncomfortable within short period of time If the microphone didn't crap out on me, I might have been a bit more forgiving, but that was my final straw with an already mediocre, over-priced headset. Maybe you'll have better luck with your cord, and the price here at Amazon is definitely better than the price I paid for it, but I would definitely recommend looking around further. Personally, I just picked up a pair of Sennheiser PC150s to see what all the fuss is about and I'm fairly happy with them so far. I'll probably post a full review on them in a bit, once I've had more time to evaluate them. 
A119RXMJVYX5QT 0521620082 May 12, 2001 5 7 4.0 good introduction to physics of finance The book is a quite nice introduction into the concept of application of physics to financial markets or to say better financial models. Both authors have published numerous papers in this same field, and this book I would say clearly summarizes some of their work as well as the work of other researchers. As I said the book is a good introduction to the subject, and it does not go into some great detail of each topic discussed, so if you are interested in something more detailed I would recommend not to read this book (but only if you already are familiar with the general topics of financial modeling). Authors presented current research results, whith a very nice and detailed bibliography, which I would recommend using if you are very interested in financial modeling, as there are some very good research papers and books cited. As an introduction the book goes on to describe the basic points of today research process in this field, and some of the questions that yet have not been answered. There is very nice presentation of random walk and Levy processes, which seem to be quite an attraction in current research. Scaling and correlation is explained from the level of indices as whole down to a individual company stock prices. Some other topics which the authors discuss are:scaling, time correlation, correlation of financial time series, ARCH and GARCH processes, market turbulence (quite an interesting connection to physics), where they end the book with some option pricing theories. The book is written in a very understandable language, where basic probability theory should be known to the reader. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this field, but also to researchers, where I think they would find this book very useful introduction, as it describes some of the major work done in this field. 
A119RXMJVYX5QT 0961408804 September 18, 2000 11 12 5.0 The best book ever for applied math This is the best book I have read on applied mathematics. It simply contains everything you would need to fully understand the theory and application of applied mathematics. The book is well written, while it requires general knowledge of linear algebra and matrix computation. The explanations in the book are very clearly stated and very understandable. Very very good reference for applied math. The material really makes a wonderful grasp on why and how to apply mathematics to some very demanding and complex structures that we deal with in science. Every serious applied math person should have this book on the shelf, it really deserves it. 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH B0000D90BR December 4, 2003 39 43 5.0 Small, sexy and built like a tank. 4 Stars This new laptop replaces a Toshiba A15-S127 that we bought 3 months ago and one that died 4 weeks later when the LCD screen cracked. This one still confuses my wife and me given that the thing spent most of its time in its carry case and it bore absolutely no external damage on the laptop's shell. To add insult to injury the store we bought it from wanted to charge us literally 2/3rds the cost of the thing to repair it, manufacturer's warranty be dammed, I guess. Suffice it to say that we won't be buying Toshiba products again nor shopping at this store (who's name, by the way, rhymes with Stomp Youse Say), ever again. I would have reviewed the S127, but what's the point? We hardly had it long enough to get to know it. When Sony began producing computers, I was less than impressed. Yet another big name producing very shiny products that look great while using second rate parts that deliver underwhelming performance. That was several years ago and while I still don't care for big name brand PCs, they are still good machines. Even though I build my PCs from parts I choose, I can't build a lap top, and after the Toshiba debacle, anything would have been an improvement. Truth to tell, I didn't really like the Toshiba from the start, but my wife wanted something cheap to take to work and use it to learn Spanish, practice her mathematics and watch the occasional movie, and the Toshiba did a fair job at all of those things. The Sony PCG-505DX is a vast improvement in every category, though it was twice the price. The 505 features a 1.5 Ghz Pentium 4 Centrino processor- possibly the most important consideration when buying a laptop these days. The CPU scales its speed and processing ability to conserve power and extend the usability of the lap top. With the full charge the 505 will run for nearly 5 hours when doing things like word processing. Obviously, the more things you do, the shorter the battery life will be. The Vaio also sports a whopping 512 mb of RAM, an ATI Mobility Radeon 9200 with 16 mb of its own RAM, (a lot of laptops video RAM is actually shared with system RAM and performance takes a real hit), a 400 Mhz FSB, an 11 mb IEEE 802.11b `Wi-fi' wireless network adapter, 1 PC-MCIA slot, 2 USB + 1 IEEE 1394 FireWire ports, CD-RW & DVD player combo drive, Network and modem ports, VGA port, and a Sony memory stick slot. All of this is packed into a very small and very attractive box,. The casing also has a lot of polished aluminum, which will no doubt enhance the durability and life of the computer. Though the S127 was fully 600 Mhz faster, the 505 out performs it every category- it boots faster, loads programs faster, and came with much better software pre-installed. I actually plan to keep all of Sony's own music and video programs, which is odd as I usually spend the first day or so with any laptop I have owned blowing out all the junk and promotional software that comes with them. About the only things I removed was AOL and that really terrible office package known as Microsoft Works. Everything else will stay. Sony also wisely partitioned the 60 Gb hard drive to make mirroring the drive much easier. (What they didn't include was a system restore CD or DVD and instead require you to make your own. If you want to do this, make sure your have a stack of CD-Rs handy, because it will take 9 of them). The 505 is actually pretty much the same size as my old 486 Compaq Aero, which itself was a dynamite little machine. I love the Vaio's design and feel- it's sturdy, incredibly well made and given the luck we have had with our other Sony products, I suspect this little beauty will be around for a long time. About the only real complaints I have about it is the speakers sound terrible, but then again, this is a laptop and a general gripe about laptop keyboards in general- I just can't get comfortable with any of them. This is the best laptop I have ever owned in both performance and build quality. The screen image quality is great, the keys and controls intuitive, I only wish we had bought this first instead of the Toshiba. 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH 6304696221 June 28, 2000 2 15 2.0 I Once Thought Mike Myers Was Funny, Not Anymore... Let me see if I have this straight. Enough people went to see Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery that it spawned a sequel? That means enough people thought it was funny? Frankly, I'm embarrassed to come from the same country as Mike Myers. I'm also a little lost as to what genre Myers is supposed to be parodying, certainly Sean Connery or Roger Moore never ran around in blue velvet leisure suits, and at least came from the right island to warrant an accent. Myers stumbles through this film like a blindfolded man in search of his next one-liner or pratfall. What I really loath him for is because her brought the word `shag' back into common usage and `Yeah, baby!' became part of the cultural norm. Myers seems to be turning into this generation's Woody Allen, for where else could someone that repulsive, even without the fake bad teeth appliance and press on chest hair that looked as though he skinned a wookie, get into position to fondle so many woman. And in the second film he loses his `Mojo', a word I used long before Myers was even Wayne on SNL, so now he's neurotic. All they need now is for the third film to take place in New York and they've got the Woody Allen schtick down pat. Additionally, given how often Austin laughs at his own jokes, Myers also thinks he's funny. What he probably does find amusing is how much money he's making. So what's the film about? Who really cares, since it's mostly Myers mugging for the camera as though he were some drunken college student who has just discovered that one of his frat buddies has just pointed a video camera at him. In fact all they did do is recycle a tired plot then attempted to make it funny. Basically, (and I mean that in the most literal sense), Powers' nemesis, in 1967 Dr. Evil has himself frozen in suspended animation so that he can awaken in 1997 where he can threaten the world without having Powers around to thwart him. Little does he suspect that Powers has himself frozen so he can be there when Dr. Evil gets out. Myers is actually Dr. Evil as well and as such does make me laugh. We also get to see Myers pretend to be the `stranger in a strange land' bit when he discovers that all of tired old cliche lines that he used in the 60's are now surprisingly out of place, improper and offensive. Yeah, like the world has just gotten so much more civilized in 30 years. It became a tired race until the next time Austin said something inappropriate so everyone could stop and stare. Andrew Dice Clay gets the same reaction and he isn't funny either. Maybe my tastes are too refined, but since almost anything by Zucker & Abrams makes me laugh, I somehow don't think so. 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH B00002EPYI May 30, 2000 6 6 5.0 A Stunning & Epic Story Wrapped In A Great Game! Wing Commander: Prophecy is without a doubt one of my all-time personal favorite games for the PC. Aside from the fact that it gracefully and heroically retires Christopher Blair (Mark Hammil) from the series, the game is an expertly crafted piece of entertaining with only a few (stylistic) flaws. It also improves greatly over Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom by making combat missions longer than the video cut scenes, something that dogged its predecessor greatly. Prophecy has such eerie underpinnings that work together with the game and live action cinematics to make for an awesome story. It is also the start of a new generation. After the defeat of the Kilrathi by Blair in Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, the Confederation finally has peace with regards to their once feline adversaries and the Cult of Sivar. But there in lies the crux of the matter for an ages old Kilrathi prophecy points to a time when darkness will descend upon the universe and the Kilrathi will die, bathed in their own blood and their once mighty claws no match for the coming evil, a time that they call Kn'Thrak, (A translation that means either `darkness' or `evil'). And it all begins with the destruction of a Confederation survey ship analyzing the destroyed Kilrathi homeworld in the Kilrah System by an unknown race. There Shall Come A time When one who has the heart of a Kilrathi, but is not Kilrathi born, shall rain cleansing fire down upon us, and Kn'Thrak, a time of great darkness, shall embrace us. We are then taken to the TCS Midway, a gargantuan super carrier that will be the focus of the game and your home base for the duration. It is truly a magnificent ship and about the same size as Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer-about 8,000 meters in length. It acts as a mobile base for the Terran Confederation and designed to be the center piece of a larger armada. It is here that we meet Lance Casey-your character-who is fresh from the academy and son of a famous TCN pilot. We also meet up with old Wing Commander alumnus-Maniac (Tom Wilson) who takes every opportunity to belittle Casey until getting his comeuppance in the worst way and by numerous members of the Midway's crew. Basically it's your job to figure out just who these new aliens are and what they want. What they apparently want is to slaughter everyone and everything they come across, which is great because that's why you're here! There are heaps of missions here and they are all a great deal of fun. Missions range from standard Combat Air Patrols (CAPs), to seeking out and destroying capital ships, taking down freighters and search and rescue missions. One of the most memorable moments of the game is a missile launch, especially the Swarms, which leave twisting contrails as they streak off towards their targets. Origin really did a fine job on the new fighter designs-they no longer have the blocky, slab-like look that Price of Freedom had, but instead have a more graceful, rounded look. Most of these ships are also a joy to fly, conveying a great sense of speed and maneuverability, though less so with bombers like the Devastator. Sid Mead (of 2010 & Blade Runner fame) was hired on to design the alien Nephilim/Phylum fighters and capital ships, and produces true wonders! The fighters have a beautiful aquatic-insectile look to them while the capital class starships resemble nothing most people have ever seen. They are both fearsome and invoke no small amount of curiosity from the player and made me want to find out more about this dark and enigmatic race. Mission designs seems to have been a priority at Origin, because they are expertly crafted and bear much resemblance to Freespace 2, and lack the time-sensitive nature that plagued many of the X-Wing & TIE Fighter missions from LucasArts. I also retract my title comment in my Freespace 2 review-Wing Commander: Prophecy is as good a game. The missions take priority over the cut scenes, the post flight ones become annoyingly repetitive, as there are only 2 or 3 to see and you see them often. Beyond that this is Origin's swan song as there doesn't seem to be any movement from them to sequel it beyond Secret Ops which only adds new missions, good as they are. This is a fantastic game-it both looks and plays great while possessing a solid and engrossing story. Superb! 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH B000035Z2S May 3, 2000 2 3 4.0 Typical Disney fare, but it delivers fun and laughs. Sure most Disney adaptations bear as much resemblance to the original as the Taj Mahal does to a Kentucky cinder block trailer home, but that doesn't stop them from being fun. Tarzan is one such adaptation that has to be sanitized in order to marketed to seven year olds. The movie scores big by being attractive-Disney's production values are always evident in art, animation and choice of voice actors for the characters (Lance Henrickson as Kerchak, Minnie Driver as Jane Porter, Brian Blessed as Clayton). If they had produced it to follow Burrough's novel, I have a feeling that Tarzan snapping the necks of natives wouldn't not have gone over well with the parents or the seven year olds who went to see it. The most enjoyable part of the film is Jane, who steals the show away from Tarzan, and you know she is going to fun when she first appears. She has a nice perky/adorable/befuddled quality that Rachel Weisz's character, Evelyn Carnahan had in the Mummy. The film follows Tarzan from his ship wreck arrival in Africa, his parent's death at the claws of the leopard Sabour, to his adoption by the apes. And like most Disney films, it explores the concept of belonging within a group that mostly treats Tarzan as a pariah or outsider. Tarzan is torn between his growing affection for Jane and his loyalty to Kerchak (his surrogate father whom he is always trying to prove himself to). Brian Blessed's great white hunter, Clayton, falls short of being a really serious villain only interested in capturing the apes for the money they will bring. His betrayal of Tarzan and Jane fails to impart any real sense urgency, given the ease with which they are defeated. Beyond that the film succeeds by being fun. The visuals are stunning, and while some viewers griped about Tarzan's skateboarding through the jungle, it is on screen for all of 45 seconds. The CGI jungle sequences are excellent and mesh beautifully with the cel animation. An enjoyable little film-good for kids and adults. 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH 6305750750 February 27, 2000 0 0 4.0 Star Wars Episode 1 I must admit that while most people are big Star Wars fans, I am a huge Star Wars fan. I knew that no film could live up to the hype Phantom Menace had received, and with that in mind I went in without any expectations. Is Phantom Menace 'Star Wars'? Yes, but it doesn't live up to the previous three story-wise, special effects notwithstanding. Phantom Menace suffers mostly from poor writing, the introduction of midi-chlorians as a way to explain one's connection to the Force was a catastrophic mistake. In a few sentences Lucas stripped away all of the mystery and majesty from the Force and summed it up with a Treknobabble explanation that space here doesn't allow me to explain. There were other gripes, but nothing quite as glaring as the midi-chlorian nonsense. On the up side, Ewen McGreggor and Liam Neesan do more than enough to hold one's interest, and when the Jedi are on screen you captivated by the specticle of flashing lightsaber blades and the awesome power of Jedi Knights. Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker is cloying in squeaky-clean cuteness. Natalie Portman was a joy to see on the screen, but the character was too stiff, let's hope Queen Amidala losens up in the second film. And, as sure as I was that I wanted to see Jar Jar Binks hewn in lightsaber pate, he actually didn't annoy me as much as I thought he would. Visually, the film scores big with people who like the best special effects ILM can produce, but as with the end battle of Return of the Jedi, the end battle in the Phantom Menace suffers from the 'too much too fast and not enough time to enjoy it', too many zipping vehicles on the screen at one time, and lacked the graceful elegance of the end battle of A New Hope. The centerpiece of the Phantom Menace is the epic lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul, and is the best part of the film with its heart pounding kinetics. When I see better spaceship designs in computer games like Starcraft than in a Star Wars film, I'm given to wonder. Doug Chiang is an excellent artist, but his conservative vehicle designs fell flat. It also lacked the humor and sense of fun had by the other three films and its tone more serious than it really needed to be. Bring back Joe Johnston, Bill Berg and Phill Tippet to the design team and see what happens. 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH 0786927771 August 11, 2003 9 10 3.0 Too small of a book to cover too large of a series- 3 stars The New Jedi Order has had, like it or hate it, a staggering effect on Star Wars and the Expanded Universe as a whole. Much loved characters have died while the galaxy far, far away has been turned upside down by the extra-galactic invaders known as the Yuuzhan Vong. Much as the Star Wars novel line has been passed from Bantam to Del Rey, so has the role playing game transferred from the now-deceased West End Games to Wizards of the Coast, (No surprise, really. Hasbro Toys owns Wizards and Lucas owns a big chunk of Hasbro). I never liked WEG's D6 take on Star Wars- I always found the 'Bucket-O-Dice' game system pretty unheroic and inflexible. On the other hand, I much prefer D20- it works quite well in the Star Wars milieu largely because it was developed for Dungeons & Dragons, which is super heroic adventuring and that suits Star Wars to a T. However, regardless of what I thought of the WEG game mechanics, their source material was always first rate (kinda like Shadowrun- lousy game system, great source books), especially the source books released for the various novels and comics, such as the Thrawn Trilogy, Dark Empire, or the Tales of the Jedi Companion. Conversely, Wizards of the Coast seems to have a different philosophy regarding their Star Wars source books. On the one hand, Truce at Bakura was a single book that got its own hard cover from WEG, meanwhile Wizard's gives us one hard cover that encompasses nine books of the New Jedi Order. While it may not have been feasible to do nine books, it does seem a lot of information to distill down into one 160 page book. Plus the West End Games material the had the benefit of being written, in many cases, by authors who wrote the initial novels, often adding more detail and background. A huge bonus considering that many of these books were also bought by people who didn't play the game at all. Basically, the New Jedi Order Source Book breaks down the nine books, (Vector Prime, Onslaught, Ruin, Hero's Trial, Jedi Eclipse, Balance Point, Conquest, Rebirth and Star by Star) in chapters that includes new characters, planets, vehicles and equipment. The first part of the book details the Yuuzhan Vong, their religion, and the vast majority of their personal gear. Each chapter also includes a small star map to show the current progress of the Vong's invasion route. Also included are some adventure hooks to get a player group into the action. Plus a few minor (and very poor quality) maps- something I have already had a talk with Dan Wallace about. The book does give an excellent overview of the series, but lacks any real meat and could have benefitted from input from the authors to flesh out places, events, and characters. I also want to spend some time talking about the art that appears through out the book. It goes beyond just being bad or even terrible- it's putrid. It certainly doesn't feel like it belongs in a Star Wars book- of any kind. It seems better suited to a Vampire: the Masquerade or just about anything else by White Wolf. The only good images are by RK Post (Essential Guide to Alien Species), and even his picture of the voxyn Jedi Hunter is messed up, because when he first drew it, he thought it only had four legs instead of six so he had to go back and touch up the image. For the most part, though, the graphics and picture are on the lousy-side of awful. On the whole, though, I like the source book- the stats for the Yuuzhan Vong are great and I suppose if I had worked at it I could have done it all myself, but with this it means I don't have to. It appears though that Wizards will continue the trend of publishing one book that covers large amounts of information like the Rebellion Era source book, Coruscant and the Core Worlds- Coruscant deserves it's own book, not 16 or so pages in a book with other worlds. I'll be interested to see if WotC will release a second NJO book that covers the last half of the series or simply double the size of the existing book and simply add new information. 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH B00005V9NK February 26, 2003 8 9 3.0 Ho-Hum... Being a Star Wars fan can be an expensive way to live your life- there are literally thousands of books, games, comics, and toys to choose from, and if you're on a limited budget like I am, you have to be choosey. There was a time when Star Wars games were the pinnacle of video games- back during the original X-wing, TIE Fighter and the first two Dark Forces games, Lucas Arts produced superb quality adventures with great stories. I think Episode I changed all that as the mad rush to cash in on new Star Wars movies opened the door to mediocrity. Instead of producing only a few titles, the flood gates were open. Jedi Starfighter is very much a middle of the road kind of game. It is for sure heads and tales above `Battle For Naboo', but a far cry from TIE Fighter. The sequel to the initial Starfighter game, Jedi Starfighter incorporates a new story and the Delta-7 ship that Obi-Wan flew in `Attack of the Clones'. The story is ironically topical with modern day real life- the Trade Federation is in cahoots with a warlord named Captain Toth to produce bioweapons, leading Jedi Master Adi Gallia to investigate. The game also brings back the Fiorin Nym and his sidekicks from the original. Game play is pretty basic- fly around and shoot things while accomplishing mission goals. Since you can fly several craft, you get a host of weapons other than lasers, but also swarmer missiles, depth charges, cruise missiles and little guided attack ships that surround your target and shoot at it. When you fly as Adi in the Jedi Starfighter, you gain the addition of Force Powers that you can use against enemy ships. A neat idea, but the execution doesn't really pay off and the abilities are not as good as the other ship's weapons. As an added bonus, when you progress you can unlock other ships like an X-wing, a TIE fighter and Slave 1. Where it falls down is that the game is too easy. I could have finished it entirely in my first sitting had I not had other things to do. Even on Hard it wasn't all that tough, plus if I died, it was usually because I crashed into something and not because I got shot down. The challenge just wasn't there. It also became frustrating sometimes during missions because of the in-game chatter between pilots that moved the story along could not be overridden so that you could issue orders to wingmen. You would have to wait till they stopped yammering before you could order someone to attack or protect your target. The graphics are so-so by Playstation 2 standards and decidedly sub-par for the PC. However, it rarely suffers from a low frame rate because of too much action o the screen, plus it's very colorful. Everything is well detailed, with well designed models. Explosions, like so many other games, are kind of lifeless. The sound is quite good, though Slave 1's weapons and engine noise are nothing like they were in Episode II. Also on the upside are a mess of extras that come with it like concept art and commentaries by the programmers, always a plus. This game is best bought as a Greatest Hits and not at full price. 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH 0060392452 July 21, 2002 14 27 5.0 Go, Mike, Go!! It never ceases to amaze that, no matter how conservative the news media gets, there is always someone out there decrying the liberal media and its heinous shortcomings for reporting the news. Don't believe me when I say the media is conservative? Then revealing that Fox News is run by a cousin of Dubya should make no difference at all. And this is where Michael Moore comes in. With each page of his new book, `Stupid White Men', I found something that I already knew or something new that I didn't and found my rage made articulate by Moore's humor and gift for words. This could be a companion book for Al Franken's `Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot', though Moore doesn't waste any time ... on his complete debasement of facts. `Stupid White Men' is an account, not only of [George Bush's] rigging and theft of the 2000 elections, again, something I already knew, but also the horrendous policies and laws that spewed forth from Republicans like vomit into the faces of the American people, now so terrified they will undoubtedly welcome the new TIPS informant system that will enable families and friends to rat each other out as terrorists. How McCarthy-istic! How like Nazi Germany! But Moore's tongue and cheek approach makes `Stupid White Men' imminently enjoyable, a satire laden with facts and information, some which I already had verified before reading them here. And what he points out in simple, no-nonsense terms is that; we as a nation are in big trouble. I [dislike] Republicans; they're evil .... Democrats, he illustrates by listing all of these so-called liberals and the percentages by which they voted in Republican polices, have sold us all out and are nothing more than the second Republican party. He also doesn't fret to point out those Republicans who voted against some of [George Bush's]policies, such as drilling for oil in Alaska to sell to Japan. The myth that the Democrats fought for the little guy has been dead for a long time, `Stupid White Men' simply knocks the last few nails into the coffin. His chapter entitled `Kill Whitey' is highly amusing, while at the same time provocative as he recounts that every lousy thing that people have done to him in his life, has been done by white people. And yet the so-called liberal media (sicker) demonizes blacks as if they are the sole cause of the nation's ills, when it's pretty clear to anyone who doesn't read Rush Limbaugh or listen to Pat Buchanon, that this is clearly not the case. `Idiot Nation' is his look at the out-right attack Republicans and everyone else are making on the nations schools. They slash funding, gut libraries and pay teachers nothing then have the audacity to wonder why our schools are so lousy. Then use it as an excuse to want to privatize them or use their state as an excuse for their voucher program for religious schools. Because they know they can't cram religion down our throats in public schools, because that darn old Constitution keeps getting in the way. I didn't really care for his section on world problems, like the Middle East or Ireland. Yes, what is he said right, but his little letter to Arafat about passive resistance and civil disobedience just didn't seem appropriate given the seriousness of the situation. However, I suspect Mike was succumbing to the frustration we all feel whenever a suicide bomber blows up a night club in Tel Aviv or Israely soldiers gun down a bunch of students throwing rocks, and the helplessness that comes with both. Neither the Right nor the Left have answer for this one, I'm afraid. About the only thing we can all agree upon is that is has to stop. Soon. There is more, but I can't help myself from turning this review into a rant or my own soap box (surely not! ed.) So the only real option is to buy it and read it for yourself. From what I have heard, it keeps selling so fast that it's already in its 19th printing. ... Maybe Mike's right- maybe we need to boot these `Stupid White Men' out of power, because what they're doing just ain't working. 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH B00004VX3T October 9, 2001 0 0 5.0 Hooray for Logitech! I have owned so many mice in my life that I have bought an extra cat to deal with them. Seriously, I guage all mice I buy by how long they last when compared to the first mouse I ever owned- a vintage circa 1990 two-button Dexxa, which lasted me 4 years and three PCs. I have owned 3 Logitech mice-all with wheels, one cordless and finally, this blue and silver little gem. Firstly, it's cheap, second, it ain't a Microsoft product. Third, set up time was as long as it took me to get it out of the box and slapped into the back of my system, which was about 13 seconds. Computer users of the world, get rid of your ball-mice and buy an optical mouse right now! Gone are the days of poor response from your mouse pointer because the ball and/or internal wheels are gummed up with dust, Fritos or salsa dip. It's great for applications like PhotoShop, fantastic for games like Unreal Tournament, Elite Force, and Homeworld- where there are a lot of sweeping movements. Movement is precise and accurate, the feel in your hand is comfortable, unless you have really big hands, then it might be a problem- plus it glows bright red when in operation, so that might be a selling feature to people who like lots of blinky-winky lights on their equipment. Is there a downside? Sometimes, you may accidentally bring up the Logitech control menu in the middle of something else you are doing- no big deal. Buy this mouse now. 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH 0345414136 May 28, 2001 4 5 5.0 Guns! Guns! Guns! Oh, and some other stuff, too! I really enjoy the Del Rey Star Wars "Essential Guides...", they are for the most part well written and generally well conceived by authors who genuinely love Star Wars. Bill Smith's work on "The Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology" is a fun tech book on everything from blasters and lightsabers to ground based turbo laser batteries, vaporators, comlinks and sensor jamming technology. The book also lists the corporations that produce the equipment people use in day to day life. I find that this tends to add a sense of realism, since no one uses entirely generic items that are provided free of charge to everyone...like on Star Trek. The book is also well detailed with lots of art, both three-dimensional sketches and line drawings, accompany the text that describes each object. Often, in the case of unique items, Magwit's Mystifying Hoop, explain who used it and why. Unfortunately, if teleportation is so common that performers can use it in their stage acts, why isn't proliferated every where else in Star Wars? Mostly, the art is quite good, though I found a few of the personal weapons to be gimicky and/or poorly conceived of and drawn. Other than this is a great reference for Star Wars fans who might be tired of being buried under meaningless Treknobabble. 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH 0345420667 January 25, 2001 2 3 4.0 A Guide, Not A 'Complete' Guide to the Star Wars Universe `Completely revised and expanded' is what the cover of the Third Edition `Guide to the Star Wars Universe' says, but when those who own previous editions flip through the pages, they find a great deal of what they have read before with scant passages of new information, and Slavicsek professes to be a huge Star Wars fan, I find it odd that he completely misses entire series of novels-like the Aaron Alston series of X-wing books. Plus Slavicsek touches on the Phantom Menace with character bios, places and equipment, but he ignores a lot of the other material-books and comics-that came out after the film. As well there is very little new art, and none of the art is original, rather pictures we have seen before, (and gives us one of the dumbest pictures of Corran Horn I have ever seen). He makes no mention of Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, which in my opinion is one of the best pieces of Star Wars related material released in the last five years. Now, that is not to say that the book isn't worth the money. It is overflowing with all sorts of obscure facts from sources that many people might not otherwise read-like it draws heavily on the Star Wars role playing Game material (West End Games, not Wizards), though I suspect that it mainly because Slavicsek wrote a lot of those books as well. It takes from comics, novels, movies, even the forgettable Droid and Ewok TV shows, and the two Ewok movies, even the Holiday Special, which we won't talk about. Ever. I think it falls apart because they released it too soon. It covers Vector Prime, but none of the five other books that followed it in the New Jedi Order series. No mention of `Onslaught', `Ruin', `Heroes Trial', `Jedi Eclipse' or `Balance Point', and perhaps Del Rey should have waited until they had been published before releasing this to make it even more up to date. Still, it is an excellent source of Star Wars information, a great source for role playing material and a reference to all the books and comics you haven't yet read. Not great, but still pretty darn good. May the Force be with you. 
A11A8GWG0IXBZH B00000IQVM August 7, 2000 0 1 4.0 Guilty Pleasure Series #1 I don't know, I really liked this goofy little film, it had a lot of things I like in big budget B-science fiction films, not least of which is Jamie Lee Curtis who seems to be enjoying the Weaver effect wherein she becomes more beautiful as she matures. I mean, sure we have seen this film before in Alien, Leviathan, The Enemy Within, the list is actually endless, but who cares, because `Virus' had some neat ideas to spruce up the old concept of a haunted house. It also had some first rate talent, as Donald Sutherland plays an extra crusty captain of the tug vessel Sea Star that loses its barge of uninsured cargo in the middle of hurricane. However, William Baldwin hasn't got anywhere near the talent or class of his brother, Alec, and seems to coast through this film like he does in anything he does. When a Russian research vessel monitoring the Mir space station comes in contact with an alien space craft that infects it with some form of attack program, it downloads it into a sea going monitoring vessel. This program immediately learns all its can from the database and sets about to make some little robot buddies. After a while it discovers that its can't build some of the more advanced robot parts and instead substitutes human body parts for those it can't make. When the Sea Star finds the damaged Russian ship the suicidal captain believes they can salvage it then force the Russian's to pay for the expensive ship's return, but only so long as they aren't any survivors. The crew of the Sea Star searches the dead ship- the power has been shut off and every transmitter has been destroyed. And once power is restored things begin to happen, such as crew members disappear while little scuttling attack robots armed with nail guns begin to appear. Reactivated, the malevolent AI continues its previous task of building cyborgs-robots assembled with human parts it cannot build. The machine that begin to appear are gruesome monstrosities-mechanical legs with muscles strong between them, bare skulls with partial brains, etc. lots of H.R. Geiger type stuff. However, I myself would have preferred a purely robotic look rather than add the visceral human element. When the find a pretty science officer huddled in a locker, the crew disbelievingly learns the fate of the crew, the captain just wants to kill her so there aren't any survivors. The captain will get his wish when he sells out his crew by convincing the AI that he is the dominant life form among the humans which the AI considers an infections- a Virus. The AI thanks the captain by eviscerating him then sends the new Captain cyborg out after his former crew which is currently flooding holds with fuel so they can blow up the ship. The captain has given the AI the location of an island which contains a series of satellite transmitters there which it can use to broadcast itself across the planet, infecting everything. The success of which would actually make a pretty cool movie in itself, sort of like Terminator but caused by aliens. Anyway, realizing what is going on around it the AI dispatches its heaviest combat cyborg to deal with these pesky human viruses before they blow up the ship. There are some silly things in this movie, and the characters are not all that likeable, and I would have preferred the Sea Star crew to be a little closer knit. These people have worked together for years one assumes and the captain pulls a gun on his engineer in the first five minutes of the film. The special effects are first rate, especially a lot of the model work with the Russian science ship being tossed around in a hurricane. The robots are very nice, with a neat arachnid look to them, but I would have preferred if they had gone with the idea that, with each successive generation of `bots built they look more and more advanced. Oh well. I liked Virus-it had good effects, good gore, and Jamie Lee Curtis in a tight purple sweater, and honestly, what else are you looking for in a film like this? 
A11ABAE6VHRPK1 B000002TQA April 10, 2003 3 4 5.0 Boogie On I first heard Canned Heat when they released their second album, "Boogie With the Canned Heat" and I was hooked for life. They were the best "white boys playing the blues and boogie" of all times. Alan Wilson was a great blues songwritter and guitar player. His singing was also very good. Larry Taylor was, and is the best bass player around. He never gets the recognition he deserves. He turns up everywhere, even on Tom Waites albums. Bob Hite was a great and underrated blues shouter and master of ceramonies. De La Para was as solid as they come on drums, and still is. The real standout of the original lineup was Henry Vestine. A forgotten standout blues guitar player. Hendrix used to go see him play, and John Fayhe sings his praises to this day.Unfortunately these boys lived the blues and personal demons got the best of three of them. Wilson, Hite and Vestine have all departed this life, but they left behind some great blues and boogie for us.Canned Heat continues to this day, but to realy experiance them, you must hear the early band. This is a good sampler of that band. Due to drug and substance abuse problems, Harvey Mandell plays guitar in the band in place of Vestine on a number of songs. He is also a great, and forgotten, blues guitar player.Also, check out one of their early live albums for a feel of what they were all about. I hope that one day they receive their due. They have certainly paid their dues. In the words of Bob Hite, "Don't forget to boogie!" 
A11ABAE6VHRPK1 0671024248 March 9, 2001 1 1 5.0 Read This Book For many years I stayed away from Stephen King. One of my friends read him extensively and highly reccomended his work. But, I was never into the horror genre. Finally, I picked up a copy of "The Shining". I was hooked instantly! King can scare you, but he can also pull on your heartstrings and other emotions as well. What attracts me most is his developemnet of the characters. By the books end, you feel that in finishing the novel, new friends are leaving after a long visit. His insights into personalities of different people in different difficult situatioons is remakable. "Hearts In Atlantis" is exactly like this. While this is not the type of book you would expect from King, you are pleasantly surprise. Having grown up in the time frame of these stories, it was quite a sentimental journey for me. A long book which I read quickly. I hated to arrive at the end. Several short stories held together by a thread of characters common to all of them. Well written and capivating. 
A11AITBLOF0FE B0009PXEEU July 22, 2005 65 67 5.0 These 'phones are amazing (rating based on remanufactured RS-110) First, a note on buying these remanufactured (I'm not taking off a star since this is lumped with the NEW RS-110 reviews): They say here 'remanufactured to like-new condition'--a bit of an overstatement...I can see noticable scratches on the phones and a fairly small chip of plastic is missing from the corner of the transmitter (but I'm pretty fussy and notice that stuff). Still, condition is good and earpads look new (thank goodness). Comes with all accessories and panasonic AAA's. Still, for the savings (1/2 price) I can deal with some surface marks. I'm satisfied with my choice to buy remanufactured, but next time I might opt to buy new. If scratches will bother you, buy new. Now about the phones: Reviews that say they are plug and listen are true. I first had to find the battery compartment (well disguised behind one of the earpads)...just turn the pads sideways (eitherside) to reveal what's behind them. The reception is good, note I'm using these in a residential neighborhood....when I get back to college I'll update. I walked outside and to opposite sides of my house and to the basement...still soundin' good. Once in a while I do get some static, but (for me) it isn't constant or common enough to make this an annoyance....living in a city area or apt might cause more interference (more wireless phones etc). The sound: Nice base, not too heavy, just right. The sound is really crisp and clear. I use these to listen to my music (CDs and LPs) and DVD's wirelessly. They seem pretty comfortable despite size, the padding on the top and the earpads is very soft. They do look hilarious on me (according to my sister I look like I should be DJing). As with most wireless phones these are big cans, but they aren't ugly...just BIG. And since I'm wearing them mostly indoors, I'm not worried about the size. Recommended for a good priced and good sounding wireless headphone. 
A11AITBLOF0FE B0000AERI5 March 25, 2004 8 8 5.0 Solid product, nice price. This product (unlike others I've tried) does not skip when walking with it. True, the bottom feels a littly flimsy, but trust me this player will not open up or come loose. I've carried it around with me, and sometimes I keep it in my bag's front pouch...the headphone cord is just long enough for that. pros: -plastic body wont show scratches -the player is very light, makes it easy to carry! -the display is very informative...birate, track name, battery life and so many other options I've yet to master -the size is also compact..too me, smaller then it looks in the picture (comparing it to my sony psych it's smaller and lighter) -reads mp3 cds flawlessly and is pretty quiet too -firmware upgradable (and very easy to do, just download from www.iriver.com and burn the 'hex' file onto a blank cd or cdr...this feature is good because as formats change in feature iriver will be on top of it -comes with ear buds (average, nothing to write home about) just to clarify, the headphone cord length is supposed to be one long and one short cuz you put the left cording around the back of your head so nothing dangles in front of you...it prevent tangles and is actually really cool..I just can't get the darn ear buds to stay in properly -comes with car adapter (I have no interest in using this..but FYI does not come with the power charger, just the cassette thing (so you'd have to buy a power adapter or run on AA batteries in the car) -has 1 year warranty...pretty decent -comes with 2 AA duracell batteries cons -no AC power adapter to run it on at home (FYE sony AC 4.5V adapter works fine with this player, I have one from my sony portable cd player)...at ... it's around $ -no backlight...I know they did this to cut costs, but I would have liked it -earphones are not too comfy in my ears and sound is nothing more then average (plan to upgrade)... -LCD scratches easily (mine had small scratches out of the box..but nothing major For amazon's sale price, this player does the trick. On mp3 cd's you can fit somewhere between 150 to 200 songs depending on the quality/file size...and I don't use wma but you can fit more using that format Update: Battery life is acceptable. Seems to last between 10-12 hours...I don't think it's really the 16 advertised, but products always overshoot battery life. I am probably going to buy NiMH batteries because of the fact it's cheaper to recharge, then to keep buying batteries. With fairly regular use you'd be changing them at least once a week. Still a solid product. I run it from an AC adapter when I am doing hw at night. No problems like other ppl stated. And the battery indicator is in fact fickle (as one review says). It says the battery is fully charged when I know it isn't and then it indicates suddenly the battery is nearly out. This is the only flaw on the player, if it's even a big issue. Carry a spare set of batteries anyway. This player does not skip when the battery is low (someone else experienced this)...it plays fine until battery drains. Hope this helps. 
A11AR2A62AXQI8 0060247967 November 1, 2003 1 1 5.0 My daughter wants more! My 6yo daughter and I have been learning baout ancient Egypt, and I picked this book up to have add some light fiction to our theme. It was great! The narrative is presented as a diary/scrapbook with pictures, sketches, ticket stubs and a number of other objects that add visual interest and require very small children to make connections. The clues were easy enough for a young child to make sense of and there was enough there to keep an adult laughing too (one of the clues was "a red fish"). The book also requires the reader to decode two messages using a simple substitution table (one letter=one symbol). My reluctant little writer spelled out the whole message herself, several sentences' worth. She also requested more Seymour Wombat books. We just got "The Mystery of the Monkey's Maze" and look forward to enjoying more mysteries as Mr. Cushman writes them. 
A11AR2A62AXQI8 B00004SVM7 August 14, 2000 2 2 5.0 More polish, less anger - But still VERY good I am a very bad music customer - It is very hard to get me to shell out money for a cd. When "Yourself or Someone Like You" came out, I played it but I didn't realize how much I liked it until my ex moved out and took it. Within a month (a very short time for me) I had bought one for myself. The nineties had pretty much gone by me except for this one band. Finally, a band my age I could relate to. When I fist heard "Bent" on the radio, I knew that, for once, I would buy a cd as soon as it came out, end without even listening to other tracks. (I turned out to be wrong, since I just bought it now in August.) But I intrinsically trusted the band. I was not disappointed. At fist I thought the album was too polished, overproduced even. I didn't think it was angry enough. "Bent" is really the closest thing to the previous album. But the old melancholy is there, and the really good tracks are just as moving. It starts out slow, though. The first two tracks, "Angry" and "Black and White People" are not really to my taste, and I consider them filler. (And you can add the next to last track, "Stop" to that filler list.) "Crutch" has a bit of the angst that we have come to appreciate. "Last Beautiful Girl" is the track that really starts off the record, a really nice song built around Rob Thomas' leit motif: nineties heartbreak. This is, of course, the prevalent theme of "Mad Season". "If You're Gone" is another great song and easy to identify with you if you are prone to overanalyzing relationships. "Mad Season", the title track grows on you by degrees, until you find yourself loving it, grooving along. "Rest Stop" also resembles the previous album in theme and composition: the conversation that ends a relationship, at night, in a car, just three miles form the rest stop. "The Burn" is also a song that grows on you, and it should elicit at least a sardonic sympathy smile. There's a lot of mirthless smiles in this album. "Bed of Lies" is beautiful, as is "Leave",which is the more rock-like of the two. "You Won't Be Mine" is a bluesy crescendo that puts one in mind of smoky clubs. Excellent track. The bonus mp3 track, "You and I and I" is also pretty good, and it goes more along the lines of the previous record. Thomas sings from the heart, and his lyrics strike a chord with me. The band rocks, and they have earned my admiration. 
A11ATFXZO1DVXA 0310212146 March 29, 2000 4 4 5.0 Integrate your daily life with your Spiritual life The best book I read this year! Usually, I find that books or sermons on 'Spiritual Disciplines' cause a short-term spurt of motivation, followed by longer-term disillusionment. Eventually I feel guilty for not measuring up, and finally I ignore the issues. Ortberg has a totally different approach, which had a very different impact on my life. Instead of telling us to work harder, pray more, get up earlier, etc, he shows us how to view the daily activities in our own lives as spiritual disciplines. He explains that the phase of one's life is no excuse for not growing spiritually. For example, a mother of small children might not be able to schedule large amounts of solitude and quiet time, but rather can learn to see her daily tasks as the "discipline of the mundane". The most ordinary situations of our lives contain spiritual activities. Reading this book made me feel more hopeful, because it did not equate spiritual growth with the ability to spend countless hours in solitary prayer, rather it describes how to train ourselves to use our own life circumstances as a path to maturity. The measure of a spiritual discipline is not how many chapters of the Bible you read, or how many hours you kneeled, but how much you grew in love. 
A11B61QBGHLQDN 0449213943 February 18, 2006 0 0 5.0 Classic , exquisitely written war novel All Quiet on the Western Front presents the perspective of WWI as told by Paul, a frontline German soldier. Within a few pages of the book, I recognized the writing as being worthy of the "classic" label and as one of the best war novels of all time. It is spectacularly written in English, though a translation from German. The novel captures the action of WWI along the frontlines, including the horror of consequences of the battles. Within the larger picture of war, the novel tells the story of Paul and his fellow classmates who were encouraged by an enthusiastic teacher to join the war effort. Readers learn how the war is seen by them and how it effects them. The novel shows the conflicts between the frontline soldiers and the military leaders commanding from afar. Remarque reveals how these soldiers, often fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy, see the war as useless and hope only to survive and for peace. The narrator describes the battles and his feelings and thoughts about the war. The soldiers discuss the incoherence of their mission in the war and why the French and others are their enemies. They acknowledge a lack of enmity with their enemies and a desire to continue their pre-war lives. As one after one of the soldiers in his company are killed and wounded, Paul becomes less optimistic about the final outcome of his battles. This is a powerful novel that should continue to influence readers' views of war. The lessons taught in it have proved as relevant today as when they were written. It is also a well-written, intriguing book that I fully recommend for study or pleasure 
A11B61QBGHLQDN B0000DCGT0 December 22, 2003 1 1 4.0 What a ride! Seabiscuit does not disappoint. It is much more than just a story about horse racing. Seabiscuit explores a full range of human (and animal) conflicts, dreams, loss, hope and victory. The characters all experience trials and restoration. Some of the acting and set that is era-related seems staged and too made up, but the story and the main characters carry the day. I was moved emotionally by the triumph of the horse, the jockey, the trainer and the owner. This is definitely a feel-good movie, because it gives you every reason to feel good about the events in it, plus since it is based on a true story, it is totally realistic and believable--nothing in it is too good to be true--it is good and true. I think you will really enjoy it. 
A11B61QBGHLQDN B0000AXE8I November 14, 2003 0 0 3.0 Disappointing but still enjoyable I liked the movie but it seemed to lack the depth of story that the first one had and the special effects were more over the top than necessary. It also had some melodramatic acting, as expected. I think you pretty much get what you would expect from a sequel to the Matrix. 
A11B61QBGHLQDN 0440509009 November 13, 2003 7 7 5.0 Buy it for yourself and those who take care of your child While expecting our first baby and then as new parents, my wife and I received loads of excellent advice from friends and family regarding childbirth, doctors, baby-care, day-care, formula brands, etc. Last week, as a father with 8 weeks of experience in parenting, I had my first opportunity to offer advice to an expectant parent. I suggested she visit two day care centers I had liked, visit the pediatrician my wife and I chose, and read Protecting the Gift by Gavin de Becker. Gavin de Becker makes his living predicting and preventing violent behavior. His firm provides security and consultation to celebrities, athletes, world leaders, the CIA, U. S. Supreme Court and other security organizations around the world. In Protecting the Gift, de Becker introduces parents to startling statistics revealing the violent reality of our culture: one in four girls and one in six boys will be sexually molested by the time they reach adulthood; 90 percent of sexual abuse is committed by someone the child knows; the most common age that sexual abuse begins is when the child is three years old. Most parents live with a mindset that denies or ignores this reality. But as de Becker shows in his book, our children are living in this reality everyday. De Becker's purpose in this book is two-fold: 1) to hit parents in the face with the real dangers awaiting children, and 2) to teach parents how to avoid fruitless worry and to take meaningful steps to protect children. On both points, de Becker succeeds. Parents are raising children during an age when an FBI child-pornography sting indicts teachers, coaches, pastors and judges. It is an age of guns and date-rape drugs. At the same time, many parents experience an urgent need for help in raising children, often from the age of six-weeks onward. Parents look for family, day care workers, sitters, schools, nannies and friends to provide support in raising children. How can parents assure their children's safety? De Becker addresses this question by first focusing on the fact that violent behavior can be predicted. The book teaches that children can be taught skills to avoid dangerous situations and people. He emphasizes the development and use of intuition as a parent's key resource in recognizing threats. He cites numerous stories of people avoiding harm by listening to intuition and others who ignored intuition and became victims. De Becker shares many practical lessons. He teaches what to look for in safe child-care workers and sitters. He lists the signs that indicate a dangerous stranger versus a friendly stranger. He also illustrates ways that well-meaning parents do things that increase a child's vulnerabilities. The Bible teaches that wolves dress in sheep's clothing and that evil-doers masquerade as angels of light. Nothing fits this description more precisely than a sexual predator of children. De Becker teaches that pedophiles and rapists often gain the confidence of their victims through being overly "nice" and "helpful." They have to do this. How else can a pedophile convince parents to trust him or her with their children. Over and over, we see that pedophiles go to where they can have access to children and, like chameleons, blend in perfectly. I think people in the church today are especially susceptible to this type of criminal, because the presence of evil has been downplayed and we are usually willing to give people the benefit of the doubt and accept them at face-value. De Becker shows parents how to remove doubt and to know who can and cannot be trusted. There are several other topics in this book that I think are important to parents. The book cover summarizes one of de Becker's purposes in writing it: "By showing what danger really looks like-as opposed to what we might imagine it looks like-de Becker gives parents freedom from many common worries and unwarranted fears." A lasting impression I take from the book is that the people with whom I and my family interact are who they are not who I want them to be. I know that some people are influenced by perverse and evil desires aimed at children. Because of this truth, I think it is important that parents read this book. I also suggest that adults, especially women, read de Becker's bestseller The Gift of Fear. 
A11B61QBGHLQDN 0312243022 January 21, 2003 2 6 2.0 What was the point of that? Yes Michael Cunningham is a wonderful writer of prose, but it is inserted in unrealistic streams of consciousness revelations during his characters' mundane activities. The lack of action in this book causes the focus to be on the characters who are revealed as self-absorbed, narcissistic and somewhat delusional while consistently whiny. It is not hard to discern why this book, as insignificant as it is, has been lauded by the press and Hollywood. It caters to sympathies that the press and Hollywood universally suscribe to without a search for greater truths or real meaning. Additionally, the writer creates no sense of urgency or intrigue for the reader. It is the equivalent of watching a soap opera in which the writers are trying their best to write like Shakespeare. 
A11B61QBGHLQDN B0007WRT4Q May 26, 2005 3 5 3.0 Pacino and Shakespeare save this movie from itself Shakespeare's lines will carry any movie above the waterline, and the same can be said of Pacino's acting. They both make this movie presentable and even excellent at times. However, the angle of the movie seems to be one of contradiction to the text, beginning with the introductory text prior to the film's dialogue (text from the Director NOT Shakespeare). This text attempts to excuse the very play itself for its characterization of Christians and the Jew, Shylock. If the play needed an intro, Shakespeare would have written a prologue. It certainly works to bias the audience in a way. The other attempt to do this is several scenes where the "Christian" characters are carousing in a bawdy house with a bunch of half-naked prostitutes. Clearly, the director attempts to make a martyr of Shylock and hypocrites of all the non-Jew characters: however Shakespeare's text is what it is. The nudity is utterly unnecessary and detracts from the integrity of the play--plus it cannot now be shown to young people. Other than those detractions, I think the film is excellent. The trial scene is superb and brings the tension of the moment to life. Besides Pacino the other actors do a fine job. Unfortunately, though I am a lover of Shakespeare, I would not want to watch this again. Author of "Shakespeare on Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays" 
A11B61QBGHLQDN 0375508465 January 2, 2005 5 9 4.0 Eye-opening, disturbing account of pharmaceuticals This book shines a light on the truth behind the myths of the pharmaceutical industry. In a well-written and simple expose, Dr. Angell writes quite an indictment against some of the larger drug companies who are deceiving the public, bilking the taxpayers and buying favorable legislation while offering very little in the form of innovative and helpful products. Dr. Angell devotes chapters to the myth of research and development costs cited as reasons why drugs cost Americans so much. She shows that most innovative research takes place at taxpayers expense and then profits the drug companies. She shows how drug companies deceive consumers with bait and switch practices, deceptive advertising, and high prices. A chapter focuses on the shady ways that drug companies "pay" doctors and hospitals to prescribe their drugs over better and cheaper alternatives. Of course, much is devoted to exposing the cozy relationship with between pharmaceuticals and Washington that leads to legislation favoring drug companies and sticking it to taxpayers. I think the information in this book should be known by everyone who is consistently taking prescribed medication or visiting doctors who treat patients by prescribing the latest product. According to the author, about all doctors are influenced by the marketing and gifts of the drug companies, and that influence effects the treatment patients receive--for better or worse. Readers will also learn how drug companies get drugs approved with relatively little solid testing of the drugs efficacy and safety. Dr. Angell does not cite many successes in patient care or positive attributes of the pharmaceutical industry (I assume there are some). She focuses on the negative practices that are hurting consumers. We are influenced in one way or another by the propaganda of the drug companies. It is important to hear the other side of the issue by someone as informed as Dr. Angell. This book is a tool to equip yourself for better health and advocacy. 
A11B61QBGHLQDN 1400048931 November 16, 2004 13 13 5.0 Great topic + great writing = great book According to Marc Gunther's new book Faith and Forutne, blaring headlines indicting corporate leaders for their greed, selfishness and deception overshadow a positive trend among American businesses that is gaining momentum: "Corporate America is changing for the better." Gunther, a senior writer for Fortune magazine, has written extensively in the past about corporate social responsibility and faith at work. Faith and Fortune, grew out of a 2001 article in Fortune entitled "God and Business: The Surprising Quest for Spiritual Renewal in the American Workplace." He writes that this article generated much more response than his previous 60 articles. Gunther discovered a movement among businesses to place greater value on spirituality and social responsibility. In this book, he investigates the drivers behind the presence of faith and values in the workplace and the initiatives occurring as a result. Gunther does not endorse or focus on a particular religion or faith tradition. He explains his approach to writing Faith and Fortune, "Faith provides the fuel that energizes these people as they strive to do business better. Some have faith in God. Others do not. But all of them have faith in the goodness of people, faith in the possibility of change, and perhaps most surprising, faith that corporations can become a powerful force for good in the world." Through the profiles and conversations that Gunther presents, he shows that living by spiritual values and practicing social responsibility have become good business in America. Gunther begins his look at faith and business with the historical profile of J.C. Penny. Gunther writes about how Penny's Christianity informed all of his business decisions from day one. Penny serves as an example of how a leader can combine faith and business for lasting success and goodwill. Readers will learn about Tom Chappell who, along with his wife and a $5000 loan, started Tom's of Maine in 1970 to "Do what is good for people. Do what is good for the environment, and make money doing it." In 2003, Tom's of Maine sold over $35 million worth of healthy, natural products while practicing capitalism with a heart and soul. Gunther illustrates how Herb Kelleher, inspired by his faith and a desire to change the way airlines do business, created Southwest Air, the most successful airline to date. His practice of servant-leadership has helped change corporate culture globally for the better. Some of the other corporations shown to be doing good as well as earning profits are Timberland, UPS, Hewlett-Packard, Herman Miller, Starbucks and Staples. Some began with values-driven founders who instilled the business with their faith and philosophies. Others like Staples and PepsiCo are changing their approach to environmental and health concerns based on the feedback of the community and a growing conviction among their leaders of their responsibility to do good. In a few of the cases profiled, the values applied to the workforce may seem in contrast with conservative Christian values as they promote non-Christian spirituality or corporate benefits for same-sex partners. Throughout the book however, Gunther effectively illustrates how people incorporate their beliefs and values into business to do good for all. He does not address whether their beliefs are right or wrong. When analyzing the best practices of the businesses or leaders he profiles, his writing skills and business acumen shine. He covers almost the full spectrum of perspectives by interviewing a variety people, including a priest, a minister and a rabbi. Faith and Fortune paints an inspiring and encouraging picture of American business that I think the dark clouds of scandal have hidden. Readers will be thankful for Gunther's efforts and pleased at how he deftly presents the topic. They can gain a greater awareness of ways their faith can serve God through their businesses and professions. 
A11B61QBGHLQDN 0736602011 July 30, 2004 2 2 4.0 Helpful book for writers I think Braine offers helpful suggestions for those who want to writer readable and sellable fiction. His provides insights learned from experience writing and reading. He is careful to emphasize that what he advises is what has worked for him and what he has learned and that it is not gospel. But, he does offer some practical do's and don't's regarding writing, especially when discussing technical things like writing narrative, dialogue, and different points of view. He inserts many poignant examples of good and bad writing that support the points he is making. Like the other writers writing about writing, Braine comes to the point that the bottom line is that writers ignore many things and sacrifice others to write and write--writing is work and takes discipline and suffering. And, Braine is able to offer encouragement and hope that it can be rewarding. I found the audio cassette at the library and recommend it to you. 
A11B61QBGHLQDN B00018D40Y April 2, 2004 1 1 4.0 Thrilling, suspenseful movie I enjoyed this movie. It reminds me of Hannibal with Anthony Hopkins. John Malkovich perfectly plays Tom Ripley. He is the evil protagonist that you end up rooting for. The intrigue in the movie stems from an innocent Italian husband and father being pulled into the role of assassin as part of a sick game played by Ripley. The movie contrasts the sociopathic Ripley who easily justifies killing with a conscience-stricken picture framer who can't stomach killing others but learns to do it. The movie also shows the consequences of evil actions--that there is no such thing as getting away with it, even for the conscienceless Ripley. The acting is superb and the plot driven at a face pace. The events are realistic and not far-fetched like so many thrillers recently. With a main character like Tom Ripley, no one is safe in the movie. He is cast as very much like Hannibal Lector--the refined psychopath. 
A11B61QBGHLQDN 0345339738 February 18, 2004 2 2 5.0 A Climactic Conclusion to the Trilogy the Return of the King concludes the exciting story of the fellowship of the ring. It offers more excitement and suspense as well as several surprises. Tolkien consistently stretches the reaches of imagination, and he always provides logic and reason so that his story makes sense and follows a consistent stream of creativity. As I read the rings trilogy, I found that it was helpful to have seen to the movies to help picture the events, characters, and surroundings. Of course, the movies made much more sense after reading the books, but I found reading the books more enjoyable than the movies. I am really glad that I decided to read them at a friend's suggestion. The Return of the King offers much more than the movie version. There is much more to the story here that the movie did not reveal, so readers will be very pleased to find additional events. Additionally, the book takes different turns than the movie. Tolkien offers characters that inspire, teach, warn, and revulse the reader due to their goodness or evil. This book involves romance as well. One of my favorite characters is Faramir. He is revealed as a warrior and leader possessing great integrity and courage. In this book, Tolkien reveals the true character of the King as a healer as well as a fighter and leader. This book has all of the insight into human behavior and personality as do Shakespeare's plays. I was sorry to reach the end of it. It was as entertaining a book as I have read. Tolkien is an excellent writer. This book along with the others is intelligently written. It is not just kid's stuff. It is stimulating reading. He tells a great story filled with complex characters and plots. The story follows a logical and understandable path that sparks the readers full imagination and range of emotions. There is no let up in the action at all in the concluding book and like the others there are surpises around every turn. If you liked the movie at all, you will indeed enjoy the book, especially if your one criticism of the movie is that it didn't make sense. The book will fill in the gaps and will cause you to appreciate the movie much more. 
A11B61QBGHLQDN B00005JMCW January 20, 2004 0 0 4.0 Surprisingly Enjoyable For a movie based on a mom and daughter switching bodies, this was very entertaining for the whole family. It was enjoyable to see the mother going to high school in her daughter's body, just as it was hilarious to watch the daughter counsel people while in her mother's body. The events that occur and the script provide for many laughs. Of course, you can't expect it all to be realistic, due to the premise, but once over that, it is funny throughout. The mother and daughter both learn their lessons after walking in the other's shoes. this is a good wholesome fun-filled movie that parents, teens and young children can all watch together. 
A11B9ILIK4SAKG 0425170349 December 1, 2003 1 1 4.0 Tree-Huggers Beware! If you're a member of Green Peace or any other radical environmentalist group, this is not the novel for you (unless killing off the entire planet with an enhanced form of Ebola suits your fancy, that is). Tom Clancy proves he is a master of whipping up a complex, plausible, and contemporary plot in this 897 page monster of a thriller. John Clark and Ding Chavez are the main characters (sorry, but there's no one named Ryan here) and they set up a multi-national anti-terrorist task force code named "Rainbow". As soon as the organization is set in place, business is booming as terrorists start popping out of the woodwork at an alarming rate. It is readily apparent that these acts are related and the race is on to see if the bad guys will succeed in their bid to unleash a biological nightmare on the entire world. The writing is crisp, and everything you could ask for in a Clancy novel is spread liberally throughout. I only have a few beefs with this book and the first one would have to be length. Clancy could have cut at least 400 pages out and the book would still hold up under scrutiny. Parts were repetitive in the extreme and I for one thought I was going to explode if I had to read through yet another diatribe on the thought processes of Dr. John Killgore! We get the point, Tom! My other main complaint is that there is little chance for suspense when the main characters of the book are all mini-Rambo's. Even Clancy admits in the last "battle" that the foes were no match for Rainbow and it was akin to shooting fish in a barrel. Where's the fun in that? And they only took two casualties in the entire book? Come on! Anyway, those are my main beefs, but I still thought that it was a great page-turner. All faults aside, it's still a lot of fun, and if you're a Clancy fan it's a must. 
A11B9ILIK4SAKG 0525947647 September 30, 2003 3 8 1.0 Stuart Smalley Goes to Washington Al Franken succumbs to using the choice weapon for liberals these days -- name calling. Pretending to be "in the know", he makes no real point in this tome except that anyone who disagrees with him is a lying hypocrite. Wow. That might be good enough for a third grade playground, but here in the grown up world it falls flat on its face. And this is truly a shame because he has such a good sense of humor and quick wit! Oh the shame of a once good mind gone to waste! If Franken wants to pretend that he can still be significant after Saturday Night Live, he'll have to try harder next time! 
A11B9ILIK4SAKG 0306811677 July 22, 2003 9 9 5.0 The Way History Should Be Written Wow. As an avid reader of World War II history, this book stands out with the likes of "Band of Brothers" and "Flags of Our Fathers" as one of the greats. This book appealed to me on several levels. First and foremost, I'm a living historian with the 29th Infantry Division re-enactment group and therefore have special feelings for that particular units sacrifice on D-Day. Also, I used to go to college twenty miles from Bedford, so I could relate to things like climbing Sharp Top mountain and strolling through the town. Other than that, the story pretty much sells itself. It's hard not to fall in love with the Bedford boys with all of the anecdotes and intimate stories that Kershaw tells in the book. The writing is crisp and sucks you in to the point where you really feel like you're there, struggling with them. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I still gasped a few times. In short, if you're a World War II buff or just someone who appreciates the cost of freedom, you should definitely grab this book. It's well-written, factually correct, and tugs at the heart -- just the way a good history book should. 29th, Let's Go! 
A11B9ILIK4SAKG 0807118613 May 28, 2003 3 3 4.0 Excellent summary of an overlooked part of the Civil War This book seems to be the only resource out there for people wanting to better understand the ten month seige of Petersburg. Trudeau writes in an engaging narrative style and handles his subject skillfully. The parts that mention the explosion at the docks in City Point and the rapid narrative that describes the battle of Fort Stedman stand out as a few of the many satisfying moments in the book. Having been a Seasonal Park Ranger at Petersburg National Battlefield, I found "The Last Citadel" an indispensable resource and heartily reccomend it to all students of the Civil War. 
A11BC4PIHPZVJP B0000029DD January 23, 2005 3 6 4.0 Six of one... Half-dozen of the other... Jeff Buckley's only official studio album is really a two-faced album. One the one hand, the original songs are amazing and point towards an unfortunately unrealized bright future as a singer/songwriter. "Mojo Pin", "Dream Brother", and especially "Grace" are three of the finest examples of their genre. On the other hand, the remakes such as "Lilac Wine" and "Hallelujah" will make you think of Sam Harris singing "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" on Star Search. With such obvious talent for writing his own songs, one wonders why he wasted time reamking these embarassing numbers. As a whole, however, the album left me wondering what could've been if Jeff would've lived to complete his second solo album - one that was going to contain ALL originals. I have listened to "Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk", and I think it would've been a magnificent album had it been properly completed. In the end, for the ultimate Buckley CD, simply take tracks 1, 2, 3, 9, & 10 from "Grace" and augment it with some of the better tracks from "Sweetheart". Avoid the other releases, as it seems Buckley's mom is determined to turn her deceased son into the "White Tupac"... I would've probably gone with three stars on *Grace*, but the title track is so mindbogglingly amazing that it's worth a whole star by itself. A solid effort - at times nearing spiritual - but the "cheese factor" knocks it down a notch. 
A11BC4PIHPZVJP B000094VMS September 17, 2003 0 0 3.0 Sooo close... I'm a huge Matthew Sweet fan, and I was thrilled to hear about The Thorns and rushed out to pick it up. On the plus side the vocal harmonies are absolutely incredible, and there are some clever hooks in the choruses. However, there seems to be some problems with verse melodies in addition to some bizarre production decisions regarding secondary instruments and such. There are parts that remind me a LOT of Crosby, Still and Nash... and those are the bits I like best. Unfortunately, there are also bits that remind me of the Traveling Wilburys, and those I do not like at all. I hope The Thorns will try again with an album made up of nothing but acoustic guitars and harmonies. I feel they'd be better if they left their string arrangements and electric instruments at home. Still, this album is worth having if for nothing else but the harmonies. Not a bad effort, but not as good as is should've been 
A11BC4PIHPZVJP B00003TFUG August 3, 2000 14 16 5.0 Start Your FK Journey Here Very rarely would I suggest picking up a live CD before any studio CDs, but here I will make an exception. "Alive..." really captures the emotion of the Flower Kings music, and will most definitely get you hooked enough to seek out the rest of the bands catalog. The first two songs of the CD "More of This World" and "Church of Your Heart" are songs of the goosebump variety... I honestly didn't know there was still music like this available. I'm the standard prog-head - grew up on Yes, Genesis, KC, etc. I GUARANTEE that if you come from a similar background, you will be blown away by this CD. Roine Stolt has quickly become - for my money - the finest guitarist/composer of today. His guitar playing is not so much fast as it is straight from his heart - it's a very emotional style, much like Steve Rothery of Marillion. Anyway, please do yourself a favor and give these guys a try. It's the best new music available in the world. Period. Thank goodness for Roine and the Kings. 
A11BH5X5C09WPA 0743270363 November 30, 2005 1 4 3.0 Quick, Fun, and Predictable Interesting enough, albeit very standard CIA-assassin-hell-bent-on-revenge stuff. Basically, the hero, Mitch Rapp, is a CIA assassin... um, "counter-terrorism operative" whose exposure by a rogue politician has led to the murder of his pregnant wife in what was meant as as an assassination attempt against him. Rapp is as unconsolable as you might expect, and proceeds to kill everyone that had anything to do with the murder. Not a challenging read... but you wouldn't read Vince Flynn's stuff if that is what you wanted. This was Flynn's fifth or sixth novel, all of which have Mitch Rapp as the central character. Fortunately Rapp has FINALLY gotten rid of, or at least isn't using his usual Beretta pistol, even though the FN Five-Seven is equally impractical as a concealed carry pistol If you like shoot 'em ups with clearly defined good guys and bad guys, you might find this a pleasant way to spend a few hours. Not for the squeamish. 
A11BH5X5C09WPA 0765304791 September 24, 2004 3 6 3.0 Fun, but not anywhere near the pinnacle... ...of the genre. The book was worth the time it took to read, but, it wasn't anything to write home about. The characters are somewhat cartoonish, and the plot paper thin. Read it if you like, and have some fun with it, but no need to go out of your way. 
A11BH5X5C09WPA 0375421572 February 11, 2004 38 41 5.0 5 stars for saying... ...some of the tough things that we, as black Americans, should have been saying for many many years. Ms Dickerson deserves full marks for having the courage to skewer many of the sacred cows that we have been praying to for so many years. Further, she doesn't shrink from taking stab at today's almost-useless civil rights leaders. It is time, and past time for us to be proud of who we are for what we are and what we have done in this country. Not because white people will acknowledge it... some will, some won't, but so what? The acknowledgement of others shouldn't be the goal of ethnic pride. That said, it should also be said that ethnic pride shouldn't be a bar to the pride that comes from being an American. It is time, and past time for us to stop seeing ourselves only in comparison to how we are treated by white people... or any other people, including other black people. Black Americans have done remarkable things. We are inseparably woven into the fabric of American history and society. It is time, and past time for us to stop pretending that we exist outside of American society. We don't. This is our country, we are full citizens... let's act like it. We should walk tall, be proud, look others in the eye and smile, or not..., but not because of hostility, but because we are sure of ourselves and our great role in the building, and the success of this country. We ought not wait for the approval of other people to feel good about ourselves. This is childish behavior. This book could have been written better, and I don't agree with every word that is printed here, but what Dickerson wrote needed to be said. Dickerson is right... the mind truly is the last plantation, and all we need do is walk out through the open gate and decide to opt in. 
A11BH5X5C09WPA B0000041OG December 16, 2002 1 1 5.0 I'd give more stars if I could! This is perhaps the richest and most moving cd I have ever heard. Oddly enough, I was first exposed to this music at Disney World's EPCOT theme park last summer. Having heard Con te partiro one time, I was hooked. I believe that it is the most haunting and moving pieces of music that I have ever heard... and I don't even speak Imuch talian. Bocelli has an an amazing voice. Strong, clear, delicate, and evocative. I have never heard anyone sing with more emotion or feeling. I reccomend this record for anyone that is really interested in good music and isn't afrraid to step outside of the bounds of their normal likes. 
A11BH5X5C09WPA 0863162649 July 6, 2001 0 0 5.0 An excellent summary Jeff Fallow does good work here. He takes the complex world of Scottish history with all of it's twists, turns, and outrages and makes enjoyable reading for the newly interested. I read this book over a year ago, and still refer to it from time to time. If you are interested in Scottish history, and don't know where to begin your studying, try this. At the very least, you will have an instant reference guide and a good place to start. 
A11BH5X5C09WPA 0812540387 October 11, 2000 2 2 3.0 Competent, but not great Ms. Kress turns out a competent work of mystery here. The story is good, and we don't find out "whodunit" until the very end. My only complaint is that the characters were a bit cliche. Dr. Melanie Anderson was just about the angriest character I have ever seen. In my own humble opinion, I don't see how she could possibly have risen to a position of responsibility within the CDC with some of the know-nothing convictions she holds. Agent Cavanaugh is the quintessential "man afraid of commitment" Read this book and be entertained for a few hours. 
A11BHLDCZ6YUQC B00000IZNA December 28, 2000 6 7 5.0 Tops for Pretend Play! I bought this for my daughter when she turned two & it is one of her favorite toys. We never even put batteries into it! She uses the little people and accessories to act out bedtime and dinnertime. Her favorite part of the play house is the bathroom which comes with a potty whose lid actually lifts up and down...a huge hit with a potty training toddler! Her people make constant use of the balcony and doors too. Her other F-P people often come over for parties. I love the fact that house closes up securely and I can hide all the pieces inside. My only request for future versions would be to make it a little more unisex...the house and accessories are VERY pink and definitely targeted to the little girl market. 
A11BSXV5YMAF3K 0684836009 January 11, 2000 42 46 5.0 COCKY TITLE DELIVERS WHAT IT PROMISES Author Passman has created something of a journalistic feat: his book is an attorney's look at the mechanisms of the music industry-usually not a particularly fascinating subject-yet he's made it great fun to read. An LA-based music attorney since the seventies, Passman is boyishly enthusiastic about his subject, and says the book is an outgrowth of his professional need to explain the basic workings of the industry to his artist clients. Though he says he is not writing technically (as if for fellow attorneys), he has nevertheless included virtually all of the checkpoints, or "deal points," that come up in contract negotiations today. The point of view being marketed here is that it pays to be an informed artist or songwriter, even if you think you don't care that much about the business side. Passman's "blurbs," or endorsements, are almost overkill: the likes of artist Don Henley, producer Quincy Jones, and longtime Warner Communications Chairman Mo Ostin. In the light of all this prestige (even the publisher, Prentice Hall, is an old-guard New York house), I couldn't believe that beneath Joe Smith's back- cover endorsement, Capitol-EMI, of which Smith was chair, was misspelled as "Capital." Minor flaw, all things considered, and happily not a predictor of sloppy work inside. Passman is an excellent choice for either personal learning or university-level classroom study. On first hearing, the title seems a bit arrogant, but Passman just about does cover it all. The 1994 second edition is virtually identical to the first, except for a welcome expansion of the opening "First Steps" section, and a detailed explanation of legislation the entire music industry lobbied long and hard to achieve: the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 (the "home taping" legislation). Passman explains the projected flow of revenues from this act back into the music industry: one third to songwriters and publishers, and two thirds to record companies. Among the nineties books on the business of the music industry, this is one of the very best. Ron Simpson, School of Music, Brigham Young University. Author of MASTERING THE MUSIC BUSINESS. 
A11BZL4EPDET73 0380813173 January 20, 2002 18 20 4.0 Great story Shoe designer, Lili Kavanaugh just managed to escape an attempted kidnapping, and while she doesn't really think that she needs hunky bodyguard Matt Hawkins to guard her body-though she wouldn't mind him doing other things to it-she's resigned to the fact that he's here to stay. Matt is instantly attracted to flirtatious Lili, and he knows that she's going to be trouble. Trouble to his piece of mind and his libido! He's never gotten involved with a client before, and he's determined not to start now. Forced together, with emotions flying high, Matt finds that Lili's charms are too hard to resist. Amidst trying to figure out the mystery of who is after Lili-and why, Matt and Lili must figure out their feelings for each other as well. HER BODYGUARD is one of the most entertaining and charming books I've read this year. Sparks fly between the flamboyant Lili, and the more reserved Matt, and it's wonderful to watch Lili try everything in the book to get a rise out of Matt. (Wink! Wink!) Lili is aggressive, yet very feminine, and I always like seeing that kind of balance in a female character. The mystery, having to do with a 1930's gun moll's pair of shoes, was so unique and it created a wonderful base to the story. There was this one scene, just before Matt and Lili run away from the bad guys, where there is this intense and vivid gun battle, that frankly, I was enthralled by. My heart was pounding and I actually held my breath! It was so well written, I felt as if it were taking place right before my eyes. HER BODYGUARD offers smart and sexy characters, a fun storyline and great writing, what else can a reader ask for? 
A11BZL4EPDET73 0843946946 January 20, 2002 0 0 4.0 I liked it American Phoebe Rafferty came to England to find a husband. She needs to marry in six weeks or she won't inherit Marsden Manor, an ancestral home she's only seen in a painting. Within a week, and only after one meeting, she's found her man: Stephen Lambert, Duke of Badrick. He's exciting, attractive and his kisses make her feel things she's never felt before. The moment Stephen see Phoebe, he wants her as his mistress. Generations ago, the Badrick family line was cursed by a Gypsy woman and they are doomed to unhappy, short-lived marriages. Stephen has lost two wives already and he's determined to never marry again. He will give Phoebe pleasure, jewels, a home; anything she desires, except love and marriage. POTENT CHARMS is made unique by having the Gypsy curse be a point of conflict. It's a first for me, and I loved it. Smaller conflicts get resolved, until all that is remaining between Phoebe and Stephen is this curse. The characters are very believable. It doesn't matter if you or I believe in curses, Stephen does, and Ms. Waide has portrayed this exceedingly well. I read POTENT CHARMS in one sitting. It has a nice, even pace to it. The sparks that fly between Phoebe and Stephen are sexy, as are Stephen's displays of jealousy. I found myself looking forward to both. There are some historical tidbits throughout the book, but I never felt as if I were being taught a history lesson. Ms. Waide has written a wonderful romance reminding us that words do have power, inviting us to believe that maybe, "I love you" are the most powerful words of all. 
A11C08FBE0Q9VI 076791581X May 12, 2005 8 14 4.0 Make this book a requirement for your teenager Even at that age they will most likely have already dealt with a sociopath... or are dealing with one at this moment... and neither of you know it. Could it be your son's best friend? your daughter's teacher? Your neice's boyfriend? Paranoia? Not at all. I got this book specifically because I could see all too clearly the sociopaths that run through mine and my friends' paths. What's scary isn't the sociopaths themselves, but the people who vehemently support them should you or anyone else try to challenge this individual. Thankfully, the author mentions this in the book. The more experience you have with sociopaths, the more this book will ring true for you. It is good to start teaching at an early age that titles such as Doctor, Police officer, Lawyer, Judge..etc do NOT = person you can trust. Not by a long shot. You're gut instinct knows more than any title society gives someone. Unfortunately however, the author throws around percentages without going into the details of how the studies were done which effects...well, everything really. And it isn't written as concise as it could be, but it is great for the laymen. I would recommend it. 
A11C08FBE0Q9VI B0007NP8PW April 11, 2005 46 70 2.0 Cingular has THE MOST COMPLAINTS TO THE FCC... ... than several phone companies COMBINED!!! Please keep this in mind when you buy this phone! THE Treo 650 gets 5 stars- there isn't much you can't do with it. Read books, play games, organize email,.. the list goes on. Cingular Wireless however, gets zero stars! I have never worked with a more frustrating company. I was a Verizon customer for years and rarely had a problem. I have had to stay on the phone with Cingular Wireless a total of 16 hours (count 'em 16!) since I got this phone only two months ago. Honestly, the sound and reception is crystal clear here in nyc, but as long as I can understand the other person on the line I could care less about their voice quality. They keep screwing up my bill and countless other things. Hard to believe, but too many things have gone wrong with my account for me to even print here in only two months time. Do they always fix the problem? Absolutely. You only have to call them about 5 times for the SAME exact issue and stay on hold for 20 minutes each time. Each time they tell you they've fixed it... and then you see your online bill showing that they didn't... so you call again...horrid CYCLE. Don't believe me? By all means, do your own homework. I know there are some great reviews here for Cingular, but if you do your own online research to confirm the above stated fact about complaints and listen to some of the negative reviews (in regards to Cingular, NOT the phone) you'll see after doing your own research that the people who are happy with Cingular Wireless are more the exception than the rule. And who knows, maybe they're Cingular reps. The number one company for complaints is not a title to be proud of and not a company I want to do business with. I wish I knew sooner. I'm giving Cingular two more months to get my bill and my features right and if they can't pull it off, it's back to Verizon for me! A great phone like this is supposed to make your life easier, not harder. 
A11C2ZX984GQW6 0609809814 January 3, 2006 10 10 2.0 Complex and Inaccurate Others who note problems with recipes are absolutely right. These recipes never saw a test kitchen. I suspect the authors reduced the quanties of ingredients in their heads to allow for smaller quantities than they produce in the resturant. ) Many of the recipes call for ingrediants you will need to hunt for, the instructions are missing steps, the measurements are waaaay off, often prep time is very long, and the result can be a disaster; an expensive one if using organic maple syrup. (I've had two things I just had to toss out.) Do NOT make "Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie, page 188. Results can also be heavenly. Phyllo Traingles are outstanding. They take HOURS to make, but you end up with enough triangles for about 3 parties. Non-vegans have no clue they are anything but delicious. (Allow time to practice handling the phyllo dough, if you are new to using it.) I ended up cutting the sheets differently than described, in order to allow the 2 tsp filling to even fit. Lots of wasted phyllo, but still used all the filling and made more triangles than you can imagine. If you are going to make them for a big reception, practice a week ahead on a half recipe to get your method figured out. They freeze very well. 
A11C2ZX984GQW6 B00005V619 November 1, 2002 2 3 4.0 Macintosh Compatibility Issue - Update for Mac Users Mac Users Only. SYMPTOM: My Mac at that time G3 OS9.1) ) did not "recognize the disk" and offers to "format the disk". If you were to do this, the camera will not recognize it. You then would need to reformat the disk in the camera, which is not an intuitive exercise. The SD media is formatted for DOS. Minolta Senior Support only says they don't know why it works on some Macs and not others. Said try a Flash Link adapter (now built-in on many printers.) RESOLUTION: I enabled the File Exchange Control Panel, using the Extension Manager. (Duh! Silly me.) After the reboot, both the card reader and the camera work fine. Tip: Manually move the two DiMage extensions to the System Folder (Extensions Folder) and reboot. The "installer" just copies things to the hard disk; it doesn't actually install anything. The card reader did not solve the problem, but, after configuring my system correctly, it is much faster than the camera is at transferring images. Be sure you are getting the "mini" adapter and that it includes "SD" in the description.Depending upon your Mac OS, you may or may not need "drivers" (file extensions) from SimpleTech. Kudos to OfficeDepot/OfficeTech who dropped shipped the card reader with same day shipping. Kudos to SimpleTech support. Bad Karma to Minolta support. **UPDATE** I have upgraded my review from one star to four. Camera performed quite well on trip to Thialand. Movies too much fun and burns battery awfully fast.(3 Batteries:1 128MB SD Card!) Battery cost exceeds camera cost. Pix turned out fine, for this price pont. You do need a tripod to get "fine" resolution to work well in ambient light. As others have noted, the menus require too much button pushing. The software it comes with is worthless, iPhoto's basics far exceed it. I'd recommed it with those caveats. I will be upgrading soon to a newer Dimage with improved quality, will stick with the minolta with the Cannon lens. 
A11C3BT4A8M9VG B00005AC56 October 9, 2002 7 9 5.0 Pay no attention to bad reviews if you have version 5.1 This is the best burning software I've ever used. It does everything I want it to do, and then some. I installed version 5.1 on my computer running Windows 2000 Pro, and it's run flawlwssly so far. Windows 2000 and XP users: Like many here have already said, get the version that doesn't advertise the "Take Two" feature, and make sure the box has a blue corner that says, "enhance your Windows XP burning experience" or something like that. 
A11C3BT4A8M9VG B000002H3T May 2, 2002 2 3 5.0 Just as good as the debut! That's my opinion anyways. I feel this and the debut is absolutely required in any metalheads collection. It's a shame that more people don't know of them, but don't blame me if you haven't checked these guys out because I'm telling you right here and now that they rule. Every song is awesome, ..... Overall, it's produced well, and should be turned up very loud at all times. So there you go, this album rules, get it ASAP if your a headbanger. And if your not a headbanger...well...I just don't know what to tell you... ... 
A11C3BT4A8M9VG B000009QPK February 18, 2002 0 0 5.0 Mandatory! This live album is pure energy. It really is what the title suggests, a whole decade of aggression compressed into two convenient discs. How awesome is that! This album came out at just the right time. It contains songs from Show No Mercy through Seasons In the Abyss. If it came earlier, the selection would'nt be as diverse, and if it came out after another album was released, it would contain newer stuff that isn't as good. (In my opinion). Well if you have it, enjoy! and if you don't, what the hell are you doing READING about stuff so cool? You should be listening to it instead! 
A11C3BT4A8M9VG B000002IRI January 22, 2002 1 2 5.0 Listening to this album won't be "wasted time". Awesome! 5 stars all the way. The best song: Wasted TIme. If it's not in your collection, GET IT! 
A11C3ZDCLJYAYH 0399237208 January 22, 2002 1 2 5.0 A great new theme to satisfy Jacques' fans. I, like so many of the other reviewers here, am an incredibly loyal reader of Brian Jacques' books - even if the themes do sometimes get a little repetitive. Not so with Taggerung! It was unpredictable and exciting from start to finish, with a refreshing cast of characters led by one of Jacques' most admirable creations yet. A departure from his usual renditions, it brought me back to the magic in the his earliest books. It has been over ten years since I became a fan of Brian Jacques, but this book just goes to show that he still has what it takes. 
A11C3ZDCLJYAYH 0394820371 June 30, 2000 40 42 5.0 An enjoyable classic of great originality. I first had this book read to me by my third grade teacher, and begged my mother to buy it for me soon thereafter, that I might read it for myself. It was my first "favorite book" (for all those what-are-your-favorite-book questions), and it continues to be a treasured classic on my shelf. The story follows the journey of Milo, a boy bored of basically everything around him. One day he receives a mysterious package that turns out to be a tollbooth. For lack of anything better to do, he puts it together and begins to play, only to find himself driving in an entirely different world. There he meets all sort of curious creatures, from a giant watchdog (literally, a dog whose body is a watch) and a humbug the size of a person. Juster plays with words as if they were tangible objects to juggle, and continually surprises the reader by turning ordinary events into magical occurrences. This book very much exemplifies the quote (and I apologize for not naming the speaker, who slips my mind at this moment) "The universe is full of magical things, patiently waiting for our wits to get sharper." Although Norton Juster's tale will probably never receive as much wild acclaim as the Harry Potter series, The Phantom Tollbooth nevertheless exhibits its own quiet charm. It is full of original characters and entertaining events, and I heartily recommend it for any child, or adult for that matter, who would like to be amused for a few hours on a rainy afternoon - especially if you think there's nothing to do! It is a wonderful book to read to a child, and the simple black and white drawings scattered throughout the text belie the vivid pictures that Juster paints with his words. 
A11C6TV5OAFQ8X B00005LDCG August 7, 2001 26 27 5.0 ALL- STAR MET DON CARLO NOT TO BE BEATEN This video, originally released in 1984 on Laserdisc and scheduled for DVD release on Aug. 21, 2001 is a must-have for any serious opera collector. Where, today, could you find a cast of this calibre: Freni, Domingo, Bumbry, Quilico, Ghiaurov and Furlanetto, conducted by James Levine? The sets are austere yet atmospheric and the costumes are beautiful and of the correct period -- a quality rarely seen in today's opera houses. The performance from March 1983 finds all the singers in fine voice. Freni, Domingo (even with a crack or two), Ghiaurov and Furlanetto are not to be faulted. Miss Bumbry's tendency to sharp slightly and in some instances distance herself from the music (you can see the technical gears working) and Mr. Quilico's blustery manner are small flaws that once gotten used to, seem to fade into the background of this generally outstanding document. Mr. Levine'a authoritative, stylish and energetic conducting coaxes an exciting performance out of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and David Stivender's chorus. This is a live performance so sometimes a microphone may pick up a violin or a soprano or tenor chorister's voice a little too accurately, but again -- that is a small price to pay for this calibre of performance. This DVD is heartily recommended and will hold it's place for a long time to come as THE video DON CARLO to have. Also, the DVD quality of this performance is to be looked forward to because of the flawed pressings on the Pioneer Laserdics when they were originally released. Bravo, Pioneer for making this DON CARLO availabale, finally, on DVD! 
A11CGGFYC1WC9Y 0664253687 May 12, 2005 1 1 4.0 Theology for the Big Picture Shirley Guthrie's introduction to Christian theology was recommended to me by Professor Roger E. Olson as a primer book for a theology/doctrine small group I started at my church, and it most helpfully delivered. Guthrie's book comes from a Presbyterian tradition that cherishes the works of Calvin and the documents of Westminster divines. Though he sees himself in neo-orthodox tradition, he displays a thorough knowledge of the London and Belgic Confessions as well as the Heidelberg Catechism, and remains reverent to them as he provocatively speaks to issues of racism, economic disparity, and human life. He also is a great writer that communicates complex subjects with remarkable ease. Guthrie's strongest chapter by far is on the Atonement, where he deals with many of the hard problems in a penal-substitution theory that normally obfuscate the fact that God is FOR us and loves us without abandoning the theory altogether. His chapters on the church, Holy Sprit, and the Trinity are also especially strong. Written in the 1960's Guthrie took on some of the hot topics of the day, which shows a sometimes prophetic voice, yet also a dated one. His view of Word Council of Churches is awkwardly optimistic, and his weakest chapters are on the subject of Predestination and Biblical studies, though he does have some helpful notes on subjects of general and special revelation. Though some might be ascared of Guthrie's neo-orthodox moorings, I can heartily recommend this book to any evangelical who is looking for a bigger picture of Christian theology. 
A11CGGFYC1WC9Y 0801065062 May 6, 2005 11 30 3.0 The Evils of Religion Called Out Controversial pastor/theologian Gregory A. Boyd known for his strong and honest opinions in theology reveals his true pastoral heart for a non-judgmental vision of the Church. With the passion of an evangelist and the conviction of a prophet Boyd claims that "the Christian religion has to a significant extent become the defender of and promoter of the Fall rather than the proclaimer of the Good News that alone can free us from the Fall." This is because the Church eats from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and therefore stands in God's place of judging rather than loving others. Boyd offers some very keen incites from Jonathan Edward's Triune Creationism, Dietrich Bonhoeffer's theology of the fall, and about the nature of the human heart's longing for self-righteousness. However, at times Boyd falls on his sword by unashamedly making the same kind of judgments of Christians he seeks to condemn them for; probably born out of response to his legion of critics. He becomes very ambiguous at times when trying to distinguish loving intervention with judging others, which leaves him more or less against the practice of Church Discipline. He also blurs a distinction between the sin of gluttony and being overweight, and then awkwardly tries to contrast them with homosexuality. Nevertheless, Boyd makes his case for a clarion call for believers to repent from judgmentalism and practice love and mercy towards not only other believers, but sinners as Jesus would. 
A11CH0J2O9MR1Y 0060904305 June 11, 2000 11 24 5.0 The Thing One of the clearer expositions of Heidegger's later thought is Das Ding, anthologized in this volume. You are free to read the other selections ("the essence of language is the language of essence" ad nauseum) but das Ding begins with a phenomenological description of a Krug (a cup) that became rarer as Heidegger got older. The emptiness in the cup is the origin, like the hand that reaches out (from the past and the future) of being and the world. The Krug which pours out its offering (Gift: poison and present) from the emptiness of the Krug: the emptiness is the absent center (the eccentric core) of being and world. The Krug offers its gift, but not the krug, but its emptiness, and it is that gift which is the gift of world.

A11CNB9UQ0VVP B00005T37Y March 20, 2002 12 12 5.0 Great little device for what it does, and more! I'm a techie. I know computers backwards and forwards, inside and out. But sometimes I want to just type up a quick e-mail, or write myself a note and print it out. Computers take too long to boot up, and are too big, or the batteries are a measly 3-4 hours long. This little VTech Companion fit the bill just fine! Weighing in at about 2 lbs, I now can read/write my e-mail while sitting in the bathroom, or in the library. If I wake up in the middle of the night and want to write something and print it out in a moment of inspiration, I can do that. Just type up an e-mail to myself, and before sending it, print it out. [this device prints to ANY parallel-port printer, except for the "Windows-Only" printers. If your printer can print text, this will work with it]. I'm addicted: I get home from work, and before signing on to my ISP, I plug this baby into the phone line, type in my password, hit "Connect", and it zaps my e-mail to me. The screen is very clear and easy to read. The ISP/e-mail contract is inexpensive too -- less than $10/month. I also love the fact that you can check your mail anywhere there is a standard phone line. The batteries! How can I forget! One of the loveliest features of the VTech Postbox Companion is that it takes just 3 C batteries, which should last about 6 months. This, to me, is a wonderous thing. This little device also brought the mystery back into online for me. I am from the BBS days, dialing up mysterious computers from far away. They hardly exist anymore, but this VTech brings the mystery of things back for me. This device *doesn't* do everything, and it isn't supposed to. I use it for e-mail, and as a portable word processor. It won't replace your ISP, but it does give you an amazing portability, with a keyboard that is comfortable. Thumbs up to VTech! 
A11CNH5D10R4II B00003CXP7 March 10, 2001 5 10 1.0 AVOID THIS I cannot think of a bigger waste of time than to slog through this movie. Don't let the great actors that appear in it sway you. It is pandering tripe. Any episode of "The West Wing" is ten times more realistic, better written, and certainly better shot. For a movie with this budget to have a complex steadycam shot left with a drop of water on the camera lens (As this one does) is inexcusable. Also there are a countless number of superfluous scenes, not even including the many many deleted scenes on the DVD. But the most troubling thing about this movie, to me, is the way it tries to make a statement about the double standard for women in America- and yet contradicts itself. The entire film focuses on Joan Allen's character not defending herself because she feels she shouldn't have to (THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN). Her character is the model of integrity- basically a saint with no flaws. But after this important point is made, we are introduced to a minor character- an FBI agent who just happens to be a gorgeous 20-something with "Hot for Teacher" glasses. NOT an older operative, as would no doubt be used in a high profile case, nor a man (4/5 of the FBI's operatives are male), but basically another model in a suit like we are always "treated" to in Hollywood films. It's interesting that the focal point of this movie is that women are held to a double standard in America and that looks will always play a part in that. Then they (the filmmakers) work against themselves by not casting realistically so that they can squeeze a good looking woman into the film- somewhere, anywhere. Yet every male part, without exception, is played by men 35 and older (closer to 50 actually). Once again proving that while leading men need not be young or attractive to get good roles, women must be both to go anywhere in Hollywood. I could go further and further into the bad plotting and dialogue, but let's just stop here. 
A11CRZIW7PW9V1 B00000IZOM December 15, 2000 17 19 5.0 A good toy but musically unsound My daughters enjoy playing with this toy. It is well made and extremely durable. Everything functions as it should. It is also really cute. My problems with this toy come as a music educator. The first and least important problem is that it only has six notes (Do to La). This is annoying but not really a problem. The major problem is that the whole thing is opposite of what it ought to be. Pianos, keyboards, xylophones, etc all have notes progressing from lowest to highest starting on the left. This is backwards. The lowest notes are on the right. It is extremely annoying to this piano player. Music education starts with this kind of toy. It is unconscionable to have this kind of gross error from a company that prides itself on the educational value of its toys.

A11D1KHM7DVOQK B000EJ9MT2 April 8, 2006 1 3 1.0 Overrated Garbage Calling this song cool or good is a mistake. This is a TERRIBLE song indeed. The lyrics are stupid, none of the artists feature their usual good flow, and anyone wanting to talk about teeth for four minutes is definitely inhuman. The beat is ridiculously overrated and predictable, while it is slightly dsnceable, it still lacks a lot. The lyrics also copy straight out from "Soldier" by Destiny's Child which is a much better song. I've seen better work from all of these artists (Nelly, Paul, Ali P) seperately. This song is definitely overrated and copied DC's track. 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B0009GJGEG June 14, 2005 0 0 4.0 Solid Come Back...They're Never Gone Brian, Kevin, Howie, A.J., and Nick haven't been in the studio since their November 2000 release, "Black And Blue". And four and a half years later... Not a bad comeback! Very suprised, I hated the first single "Incomplete" because it was boring, unpowerful, and had a country feel that made me want to gag in the first minute. Overall, the album compares to something Hanson or Gavin DeGraw would do. "Weird World" sounds almost exactly like Gavin DeGraw, but songs like "Just Want You To Know" show a style similar to their older albums, like "Millenium". My favorite track would be "Lose It All", because it's so powerful. They better think twice about releasing "My Beautiful Woman"...not only was it stupid but it almost put me to sleep. Overall, it seems the BSB have matured in a good way. Their songs are much more powerful, and the true style inside them is forming out. Oh, and to Sally Jenkins, please learn how to write reviews...thank you. Replay Value: Medium Child Appeal: Medium Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Low 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B00005JM55 May 21, 2005 6 8 2.0 A Sequel That Just Doesn't Cut It After watching Legally Blonde over a million times on DVD, it was finally time that the sequel, "Red, White, and Blonde", was released. Popping it in to my computer, I was very dissappointed. Firstly, which I'm suprised hasn't been a complaint at all, is the quality of the DVD. A lot of times there are black spots, that are very irritating, and moving objects seem very dull. I watched another DVD from another company, and the quality of that was excellent. I could have got a bad apple, but with watching this on a flat screen, this is very distrubing. Okay, so here is the plot. Elle (Resse Witherspoon) is ready to get married to Emmitt (Luke Wilson). She has made reservations to get married right under the green monster! As she is trying to bundle up guests to come, she notices that she didn't give Bruiser's (Moondoggie) mom an invatation. She hires a detective to search for Bruiser's mom, happening to find out that she lives at the V.E.R.S.A.C.E. clothing facility. Come to find out, it's not a clothing facility at all. It's instead a cosmetic testing facility, and Bruiser's mom is trapped and Elle is not able to release her. So, Elle tries to convince her team of lawyers at work to follow the case. They don't, and they fire her. Now, Elle Woods must go to Congress, and work with her unfriendly co-workers Grace (Regina King), Reena (Mary Lynn Rajskub), and Timothy (J. Barton) to pass Brusier's Bill to make cosmetic testing illegal. The movie is not as good as the original, as most sequals, and this one isn't a total bomb, but it's not quite on target. There were a lot of sexual/gay jokes in the movie that wee more hateful than funny. Also, the movie is pretty predictable. It's easy to tell what will happen in the next 15 minutes of the movie. Secondly, the movie doesn't make since. If you've seen the first "Legally Blonde", Elle graduates in 2004. There was a caption that said "Emmitt will proposed to Elle tonight". How can this be possible if they are married in 2003? Also, how can she be a legalized lawyer if she is in school? This is a big glitch in the movie, that is very distrubing. Overall, the movie is a dry sequel to the wonderful first. If you haven't seen the movie, you'll probably be better of leaving "Red, White, and Bland" for something worth your 1 hour and 30 minutes of your time. Not recommended.

A11D1KHM7DVOQK B0000DIZUR May 4, 2005 3 3 3.0 Akon's "Trouble" is rap First off, yes, Akon produced his own album. This is very rare today because so many artists have other producers and take the credit for it. Instead, Akon takes credit for his own credit. A majority of the album is about being in jail ("Locked Up", "Ghetto", "Lonely", and "I Won't"), life afterwards ("Trouble Nobody" and "Showout") and getting girls ("Bananza Belly Dancer", "When The Time's Right", and "Don't Let Up". The good thing that worried me of what would happen is that the subject of jail would be repeated again and again, though Akon decides to mix it up a bit. The gangsta beat songs "Gangsta" and "When The Time's Right" prove that they are mostly medicore and Akon's style isn't for that. The CD features "Locked Up", the first single, which on the album is the version without Styles P (though there is a remix with Styles P). This is nice because the Styles P remix is awful, and makes it too rough. Which leads to the fact of why the gangsta songs are medicore. Because Akon is an R&B. Okay, so he decides to rap, there's nothing wrong with it. The problem here is that you know, you have to...know how to do that. The "Bananza Belly Dancer" song isn't too bad, actually is quite good and danceable, with some pretty catchy lyrics, but "Gangsta", "Showout", "I Won't", and "When The Time's Right" are very medicore and are unlistenable without a skip button. Most of the disc is R&B though. Songs like "Ghetto", "Pot Of Gold" (which is the true ballad of the disc), and "Lonely" are good examples of shining R&B on "Trouble", but that basically breaks the rest of the CD, making half unlistenable, and the other half some of the best songs released in a while. Overall, Akon's "Trouble" is a nice CD full of smoothly-styled R&B, but with medicore rap. Though, "Trouble" is definitely worth the buy, because there are some wonderful songs on the disc.

A11D1KHM7DVOQK B0007P3582 April 23, 2005 6 6 1.0 Read the title of the CD Ok, believe it or not I only listened to part of this CD. Yes, one of my first reviews to not listen to the full CD. But there is a reason for this. I think I got a good enough idea on how bad The Massacre is. The first thing that bothers me is the awful, wack beats on The Massacre. Come on! Listen to "This Is 50" and try to tell me this beat is good, because it's not. The second thing that comes to mind are the boring, second-grade lyrics. "Clicky clank money goes in my bank." "Get in my car b****!". What was that all about? "Ski Mask Way", "Hate It Or Love It", and "Candy Shop" are the only songs on this CD worth listening to. If you own a radio, you'd probably heard "Candy Shop" at least 100 times this week. And if you own Game's CD, there's "Hate It Or Love It". If this CD has only one song on this CD that is good, my question to you is why even bother? Replay Value: Closet Storage Child Appeal: Low Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Medium

A11D1KHM7DVOQK B000056HGD March 23, 2005 0 0 1.0 You're kidding me, right? This has to be the worst game ever released for PS2. The graphics are ok, sometimes the tires sink into the pavement. This game is no fun!!! The cars are crappy, cheap, and slow cars. At least they could have included regular cars, you know, not "Peanut" or "Froggy" as names for cars. And top speed of these are about 45 mph. Honestly, you would have more fun waiting at an intersection of traffic for 30 minutes than playing this game for 30 minutes. Try "Crazy Taxi" and "Need For Speed Underground Hot Pursuit" if you want good racing andcar games.

THEY ARE MOSTLY ALL CONS Pros: - Volume remote...which doesn't even help peak volume anyway, so this really isn't a pro. Cons: - These are some of the most QUIET HEADPHONES I'VE EVER USED IN ANY OF MY PLAYERS! The impedance is 32 ohms, one of the worst impedances you can get. - There is SMALL BASS ON THESE! The bass is completely bloated and tinny. - The treble is IN A TUNNEL??? Honestly, is there a long tube in between these. - These have HORRIBLE COMFORT. The rubber headband makes them extremely oversized. - These are NOT DURABLE! Every single pair of these broke in the same space, with good care. The left side of the earcup, which features the right side's cord. - If there not durable, they are NOT PORTABLE EITHER. Sure, they fold up, but that's all the portability you'll get out of them. They break, one in my backpack, one putting them on the way I always do, the headband on my head, and the speakers correctly on the ear. SO YEAH! I'M KINDA MAD, EVEN THOUGH I'M GETTING MY $$ BACK. THE FACT THAT THESE HEADPHONES HAVE BAD SOUND, COMFORT, DURABILITY, AND PORTABILITY, WHY ON EARTH WOULD I GIVE THESE A GOOD RATING??? THEY ARE WASTING ABOUT A WEEK OF MY LIFE. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY FROM JENSEN. 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK 0786804408 February 17, 2005 3 3 2.0 Hard to understand I just couldn't get this book. I was at the library, looking for a good book. "Dive" just seemed interesting on the back cover, so, I checked it out. The moment I read the first paragraph, I knew it was trouble. They had not explained the characters yet, they haven't even started with a person's name. Just "I" "you" "they" "the". Those are word that are really hard to understand when reading the first few chapters of a book. I checked it in, and got another book. Really hard to understand. Is it a sequal? The book didn't say. Then yet, even other sequal books I've read were easier to read. I do not recommend this book. 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B0002UCJV6 January 30, 2005 13 14 1.0 Who needs an update? Get Norton 5.0 (1999) I am really not suprised by the overall rating of the product rating. 2 stars! That is not a good rating. I'll start by saying that I don't own this product. I've had Norton Antivirus 5.0 (made in 1999), and it works beautifully. I've purchased Norton Antivirus 2003, and have seen how much Norton AV has changed...for the bad. Really, Norton Antivirus versions (2003-2005) are basically the same thing, but each newer version getting worse. The 2005 edition is no difference. It eats a lot of RAM. Which usually means for most people, it is ssssllllooooowwwww. Live update crashes halfway through the process. Scanning takes awhile and sometimes crashes too, and not to mention misses various viruses that may be on your computer. Auto-protect is just as similar. A virus may break through any minute! Not only that, after a year, you can't use it again! Wait a minute...I thought once you pay for something you can use it again. Not with NAV 2005. After a year, your subscription is over and you have to pay for another subscription online, or buy the new version which is worse as I mentioned earlier. Honestly, isn't this enough. Some of you have the older version of NAV (1995-2002) somewhere. Just use that, considering it has none of the problems listed above (well, on NAV 1999 they ask you to renew your subscription or reinstall the software...just reinstall the software and don't buy money for a subscription!). Of course, if this is you're first time using NAV, it will be very hard to get an older version of it. Just get McAfee then. Just get anything but NAV (2003-2005). Besides, each version has the same features, besides 2003-2005 that actually do have spyware. Bottomline: Just save yourself the grief and buy McAfee or an older version of Norton. 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B0006JKVF4 January 23, 2006 4 5 3.0 Decent For Some This printer came with my friend's HP computer. The print quality is good but there are a few downsides. As far as photo quality, it is very clear and crisp. Maybe not as good as store made printouts but good enough for most. Pictures look good to me but they aren't completely perfect. Text is very good and no streaks here unless you have a low ink cartridge. The copy quality is good enough, and the scanner works better than most. But the true downside is its interface. This printer has paper jams often, and let me remind you, it does this when it is rolling, which means if you get it jammed usually you have to pull it out slow or you'll have to take the printer apart. The printer drivers are annoying, when some pages don't print at all because of a paper jam or no paper, sometimes you have to reinstall the drivers on the CD. The instructions are pretty unclear for beginners, intermediates and above would be able to install without instructions. The cartridges suck ink like muthafu(ka, and you have to clean them often or you will get some free streaks along with your print. However, I enjoy that the printer tells you on the computer if you need to replace your cartridge, but usually at this time your print-outs look terrible. And beware the dreaded red exclamation point on the printer, it's evil. The printer will be OK for some advanced users but beginner users should look at other companies. 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B0006419IM December 29, 2004 1 2 2.0 Highly Dissapointed I am really dissapointed in this film. Ben Stiller is hilarious in Starsky And Hutch, but Dogeball dodged me in the wrong way. One thing that I didn't like, was that in the first 2 minutes of the movie, it felt like I already watched it. The rest of the movie just seemed so predictable afterwards, and I got it right on the first try. Usually, this never happens. Dodgeball is more of a rental, or maybe it's not even worth a rental. If you ask me, it's really not that funny. The only part I even smiled was when they called this girl a double 0. I think that's just hilarious, but the rest of the movie was dull. I thought the DVD case was more entertaining than the movie really. It is! Go look at it! Please, don't buy. It's a rental, or even not a rental. Maybe it's a throw away movie considering I've heard the double 0 joke somewhere else. Not funny! Try again Stiller! 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B000658EP2 December 23, 2004 2 2 3.0 Not that bad really, but still a few flaws Well, the company Iconcepts make various types of hardware for low prices. I can find these products usually shopping around dollar stores and small department stores around my area. And, I found these speakers at a low price (I don't remember excatly, but it was around $5-$10), and need an extra pair in case my Creative speakers broke on me (they are almost 7 years old and starting to lose touch), I would have another pair to replace them. If you're using these for your computer, like I am as I have to now use my Creative speakers for my portable CD player as my microsystem broke (it's currently getting repaired). Well, if you're just use this for your computer and you're not going to use them often, the value is really not that bad. The design for these is great, which I love because they don't take up too much space around the desk. But, if you are using these for audio such as tapes, CDs, and mp3s, DON'T BUY! Why? Turn them up about 1/4 way and you hear this irritating humming noise in your audio, which is why I only use for my computer. Another reason is the bass and treble aren't set all that great. So, if your looking for flat speakers for your CDs and tapes, you really should do a lot more researching, but if your using them for computer use and you don't really listen to audio or video on your computer that much, they are really a great buy, and you should get them.

A11D1KHM7DVOQK B000089IYW November 28, 2004 3 9 4.0 My Review on Switchfoot's Beautiful Letdown 1. Meant To Live (4/5) It's a good song, but it was better when it wasn't so overplayed. 2. This Is Your Life (4/5) I didn't like it as much as other songs, though, I guess it's pretty decent. 3. More Than Fine (5/5) This is a great song, and it mans a lot of feeling. Great song! 4. Ammunition (4/5) Really cool rock song! It could have been a bit better, but it's still good. 5. Dare You To Move (3/5) I would have given this a much better rating if it wasn't so always overplayed. 6. Remdeption (5/5) This is a great pop/rock song. It reminds me of the good days. 7. Beautiful Letdown (2/5) Yuck Switchfoot! This songs is creepy and weird. It also doesn't have a good point or meaning. One of the worst on the album. 8. Gone (4/5) This is a good song, but it sounds to much like a pop boy band. 9. On Fire (5/5) This is a great slow song by Switchfoot. Nonetheless, a great song. 10. Adding To The Noise (4/5) This would have been a better song if the singer would have sang better. Still, a good song, and a worth listen. 11. 24 (3/5) This sounds like One Thing by Finger Eleven, though the singer sounds very annoying in the song so it sounds very bad with the acoustic instruments. CD (4/5) This CD was not flawless, but it was truly good and a worthy listen. I recommend this if you like any style of pop or rock. 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B0006399FS November 23, 2004 2 8 5.0 What? What is up with all of the reviews? Either you loathe this album or you love it. Well, I'ma one of those people who like this CD. I think the problem is people listen to way much bubblegum music. Well, I tend to like some bubblegum music, but people listen to too much and forget what real music is. WAKE UP! THIS IS REAL AND GOOD MUSIC! Listen to this a couple of times. It took me also a couple spins to like it. Overall, if you listen to good and real music, you should get this. If not, go get Britney Spears, J.Lo, or whoever you listen to because this is GREAT music.

However, most of the songs are bad and dreadful. The only ones I found good were the ones by Ashanti, Jessica Simpson, Hilary Duff, and Christina Aguilera. The rest are pretty bad. Boy bands? Teen pop girls? Don't think so. Don't think this will be very good. I don't recommend this CD. Get some better music, although I give it 1 extra star for the good songs I mentioned earlier in this review. 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B00006I5ST September 6, 2004 3 3 4.0 Nice little player. Sony did a good job with this little player. I've owned it for two years, and this is what I think about it. CD Player - 4 It works well. The only problem I've had is it would take a while to read CDs (especially MP3s). Radio - 5 Crystal clear sound. Actually, I live about 15 miles away from metro Tucson, so this little player does a great job as far as reception goes. Tape - 4 I do give it credit for it's sound. The recording, hmm... I wish it could record stuff you said into it. Equalizer/Bass Boost - 5 It's does a great job controling bass and treble. No compliants. Sleep - ? Never used it yet. Ease Of Use/Design - 3 Have to say, it's ease of use is good. It's design different story. Even looking at it from amazon.com, it looks hard to use. Overall - 4.2 It's a good little player. The price is a little high, but it's all worth it. 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B00004ZCP0 July 6, 2004 0 0 5.0 Awesome Game! Driver 2 is a great game. It has good sound,, good control, and it's a lot of fun. I haven't played the first one so I don't know how much worse or better the second version is from the first version. The only problemm is that iit's graphics are a little off, but otherwise, it's a great game. Graphics 3/5 Sound 5/5 Control 5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Replay 5/5 Overall - 4.6/5 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B0002I5RHG December 23, 2005 4 4 5.0 Great headphones, great price I bought these just to use for back-ups. However, when I listened to these, they became my favorite pair I have. 1. The sound quality is amazing, especially at $10. The bass is HUGE, hip-hop fans will love and admire these headphones, I mean can you say big bass ports on the headphones? The treble is nothing special, it's just there, nothing good or bad about it, it's pretty neutral. Mids are fantasic. All in all, sound quality is literally as good as those Sehnneisers across the isle. 2. The durability has been great, though it seems to have some weak spots. I will say the most commonly places this pair will break at (if they do) would be at the swivel earcup, the twist where the headband meets the swivel, or the head fitter. 3. These headphones are very comfortable. I suppose I could wear them for hours and forget they were on. They don't put on any pressure (sometimes they're too loose) and the fit doesn't have any effect on sound. 4. They also come with a big-plug adapter to use on DJ equipment or hi-fi stereo systems. 5. LOOK AROUND! The price for these headphones range from $10-$25, literally (even though I would pay $25 for these). I got them at a Ross store for $10, my guess is that is the lowest price around. 6. The bending parts get stuck to your hair often. Long haired people will find this slighty annoying and painful. 7. As far as comparisions, they sound better than the similar Sony model MDRV150 and Koss model UR15C. They are almost or at the same sound as the HD202. 8. Overall, this is a very good deal for me. These headphones are comparable to $30 headphones at 1/3 the price. The sound, comfort, and durability should be good enough to push you into buying these headphones! 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B00006AW49 June 13, 2004 2 5 2.0 This isn't complicated. Ok, let me start by saying that Complicated was my favorite song of 2002. Everyone loved how good it was and how much airplay it recieved. I bought this CD expecting Complicated. Well, it was Complicated, just not how I remembered. Complicated on this single is some weird remix. I hated the remix. Then I heard the rest of the CD which was actually worthless. I Don't Give and Why were both medicore. 1. Complicated (Remix) 1/5 2. I Don't Give 2/5 3. Why 2/5 Overall 5/15 30% F

A11D1KHM7DVOQK B000BC8TBY October 28, 2005 3 3 5.0 Collection of the biggest selling female group Destiny's Child, with Beyonce Knowles, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams, with over 50,000,000 records sold, slipping over TLC, call it quits on their first and last tour for their album "Destiny Fulfilled". With collection, we have all the hits y'all. From the club songs "Soldier", "Jumpin' Jumpin'", "Lose My Breath", "Bug-A-Boo", along with the slow songs "Emotion", "Say My Name", "Bills Bills Bills", and "Cater 2 U", and the songs about woman independence "Independent Woman" and "Survivor". The disc also includes three new songs, "Check On It" and "Feel The Way I Do", which are Beyonce's new singles, and the last group song "Stand Up For Love". Destiny's Child has proved that they are talented people. From their soulful singing, to their beats, etc. Picks on their greatest hits collection would be "Jumpin' Jumpin'", a true club song that's still going from Writing's On The Wall, "Bug-A-Boo", starting a new word for an uncaring man from their first album, "Say My Name", "Independent Woman", among with many others. They have also proven nice writing talent throughout their songs, writing about many differnet subjects and keeping R&B fresh. However, the end of Destiny's Child has come, and it's time to put them in the invisible R&B Hall Of Fame. It's no wonder Destiny's Child were the best selling R&B group, their talent, lyrics, and heart (well, maybe Beyonce...remember she's the one that is the talent hog) made them there. A definite 5 star collection. Replay Value: High Child Appeal: Low Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Low 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B0009XFJ0O September 2, 2005 6 8 3.0 Album with it's spotlights...don't buy this judging on Pon De Replay Rihanna's first CD debut was back in May when she did a debut with Memphis Bleek on his "534" album. After that, she was automatically signed to Jay-Z's Def Jam for her vocal talent. Rihanna's "Music of the Sun" wasn't blowing me away, but there were definitely spotlights that make the album worthwhile. "Pon De Replay", the first track and one of the biggest summer smashs, is definitely a song DJs would put on replay. Her vocal ability shines on this song. She doesn't have the brightest and deepest vocals but she can surely sing. The beat of this song is very dancy; a nice summer flirt. Another shining song is "Rush". It has a very dancy beat, similar to "Pon De Replay". Her vocals shine thoroughout the song, once again she's not a Mariah Carey, but she can sing very well. "Now I Know" is one of the best songs on "Music of the Sun". It's a balld, but it's very powerful, her vocals shine the most on this song. This song is about finding true love, and the feeling you get. Another song worthwhile is "The Last Time". Her vocals are not rich or powerful but she does hit all of the notes. It's mainly about leaving a boyfriend that was mistreating you...more of a feel-good thing. It has a very nice beat that is very mellow. She sounds a lot like Kelly Rowland in "The Last Time", as well as "Willing To Wait", another song very similar to "The Last Time". "Music of the Sun" also captures some Bob Marley styled reggae. This is where Rihanna falls a bit short in her talent. She doesn't use her vocals in most of her reggae songs, especially in "That La, La, La". The beat of the song is also isn't too hot, and Rihanna's vocals make me think it should go in the fridge. She sings in this song, but her vocals don't have a true richness like in her other songs. Also in "Here I Go Again"...there's an okay reggae beat, but her vocals don't have any power whatsoever. Now, don't get me wrong her, not ALL of Rihanna's reggae is bad. Actually I find "You Don't Love Me" to be one of the CDs most shining songs. The beat sounds something Bob Marley would go after. Her vocals are good, and she shows vibe in this song...actually in a lot of songs. The reggae mix of "Pon De Replay" with Elephant Man isn't bad either. Rihanna's new album "Music of the Sun" isn't the best R&B album of the year, but it definitely has many spotlights in her reggae, R&B, and dance tracks that make "Music of the Sun" worth the buy. 3 stars.

A11D1KHM7DVOQK B0002GMSC0 July 17, 2005 6 11 4.0 Decent BIOgraphy Okay, what made me write this review was the large amount of unhelpful and fake reviews. I've found more real reviews in J-Kwon's "Hood Hop". I mean, there's 420 one star reviews and 837 five star reviews. And there's 57 two, 72 three, and 152 four stars. Like many people have said, one star is 90-100% flawed, and 5 stars is almost or is flawless. Also, many of the one star reviews are about Ashlee, not the CD. If you want to rate the artist, there's chat rooms to do so. Firstly, this isn't really a bad album. There are many great tracks on here. Sure, she only co-wrote two tracks (Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks did most of the writing), but besides that, she has a great tuned voice. "Autobiography", the first track, is mainly a pop/rock track about her, and that she really doesn't care what people think about her. And luckily, we hope that means she's not taking herself too serious. "Autobiography" is basically a long intro into her album, which then leads into the #1 smash "Pieces of Me", a song about her boyfriend Ryan Cabrera. The lyrics (written and produced by John Shanks) are very decent, mainly about Ashlee finding someone real and can find someone that has a strong connection with her. The tune is very nice, kind of like a faster version of Avril Lavigne's "Don't Tell Me", without the gross and crude lyrics. The album includes a few songs about Ryan, like the song "Better Off". The tune is crazy good, and that "When I'm standing in the pouring rain, I don't mind. I think of you and everythings alright" (once again, Ashlee didn't write this song). Though, the album is not flawless. Take "Unreachable" for example. Not too bad, but it's pretty boring as far as insturments go. You could have a guitar to add some flavor or spice in it, instead of making it bland. And whatever happened to the strings on "Shadow"? On her first season (word for word) she said "I think strings will add a life to the song.". And, now it's lifeless. The lyrics are actually about her finding her own identity away from her platinum-selling sister, Jessica Simpson. How exicting and interesting *sarcasm*. And, imo, people should really get over SNL. Akon lip-synched because he had acid reflex (he said so on the Carson Daily Countdown), and his album is rated 4.5 on Amazon. Besides, her lip-synching has nothing to do with the album. Overall, Ashlee Simpson's debut "Autobiography" is an album definitely considering if you're a pop/rock fan and like Avril Lavigne, FeFe Dobson, etc. Replay Value: Medium Child Appeal: Medium Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Low 
A11D1KHM7DVOQK B0007M6104 June 27, 2005 15 16 4.0 Despite compatability issues and poor battery life, excellent Alright, it's the 21st century now. It's getting to the point where portable CD players are nice...but are so 20th century. I decided I needed a less-bulky and nicer portable audio device. Searching around Best Buy, I came across this. Let me tell you, the iPod is probably the most overrated portable electronics device ever. Okay, first off by reading the 1-star or 2-star amazon.com reviews, many of them are either unfair or haven't given it a chance/didn't read directions. Okay, I've heard A LOT about Napster software. For starters, which is a dissappointment, If you don't have Windows XP, go back to the search engine, because it's only compatable with XP. Macs don't count. Maybe, not guarrantee this, but maybe it will work on Windows ME. Not 100% sure, but all stores have a money-back guarantee...right? Also, it's not JUST compatable with Napster. Just because it says Napster on the box and player, does that mean ONLY Napster? No. It's also compatable with Windows Media Player 10, and I've also heard some people got it to work well with RealPlayer. Napster isn't the ONLY software compatable with this player. For features, it has way more features than the standard, or even photo iPod. First off, yes, it has a built-in digital camera. The pictures aren't crystal clear, but I have a digital camera to do this for me. The pictures are fair to good, but don't get this just for the camera. What you should get this for is for the wondeful MP3 player/organizer, radio, and MP3 recorder (both line-out and microphone). First off, the menus and organizing is unbelieveable. The menu has a few options, then those options have options, and so on. Example, if you click Music, you have artist, album, genre, song. Then, one you get into the organizer, if you click on a song, it will show up in "Now Playing". It would be better if it had a button to go back to the main menu, but it's only a minor problem. The FM tuner was better than expected and actually better than most portable radios out there. The microphone was also a great feature, and recorded voice very clearly. There is also a line-out to hook up the player to a set of speakers. If you need a car adapter, a lot of electronics stores sell cassette adapters for only about $10. The line-out also lets you record to another audio device. (Example: You can connect the TV to the MP3 player and the player will record the TV.) The MP3 player holds around 5,000 songs on the MP3 format at around 192 kb/s. Personally, I use 128, so I have about a hundred extra. It depends on how much quality you want out of your tunes. If you want so-so sounding, you'll get more than 5,000, and if you want high quality, it will likely be less. And, it also supports WMA files, so then you'll have far more than 5,000 songs. The sound quality is excellent. The player features presets for the equalizer, similar to the one in WMP, without the distortation. It also features a 3D equalizer, which many companys (Samsung, Panasonic, RCA) have been doing with their audio products as well. The MP3 player will power most, and about all headphones. The LCD is in fact proven to be colored, and it is very sharp. It is 1.8 inches, which is equivalent or bigger to the size of an iPod screen. Some players like the Rio Karma have gigantic screens; though, the look is very unappealing. The player also allows you to view your own photos, or the album art. Or, you can look at the headphones, which to me gets hilarious after a few looks. The biggest dissappointment is battery life. Ten ohurs may seem long, but in reality, not really. Most MP3 players have around 15-20 hours of battery. Though, this isn't much of a gripe for the non-travelers. Also, the USB 2.0 was nice of Samsung; giving us the best cable link from the MP3 player to the computer. Overall, unless you don't have Windows XP, and aren't a serious traveler, the YH925GS kicks the iPod in the trash. Well, you would throw away an iPod, right? 
A11D6S7D7MHWTB 6303833411 December 6, 2000 1 4 3.0 good at the beginning but then . . . We got this video to watch with our children at Christmas time. My children love the first half of the performance, but after that, they ask me to turn it off. They miss the dance of the peppermints and Mother Ginger and get bored watching Lesley Collier dance again, and again, and again. Perhaps people came to see her dance, but it seems to me that the story gets lost in the end of this performance in such a long feature of the prima donna. 
A11DHNURZ0JJCD B00004R8WF November 1, 2002 0 0 4.0 Please stop with that music!! No on/off switch, no control over the music it plays, goes off if you walk too close to it. This was in the trunk for a while getting ready to be returned (we had almost all of the sparkling symphony items already). I decided to give it a shot. Boy was I sorry. I don't understand why Fisher Price doesn't make it more like a regular piano. This and the Sparkling Symphony xylophone have minds of their own. I don't think either of my children ever even touched this one more than once. In a bag in the attic. Do you want it? 
A11E4SSDIIBHZB 1593090188 September 19, 2004 4 4 4.0 Lightning-paced Thriller This prequel to SUGAR AND SPICE, which was released in 2003, is another fast-paced murder mystery that centers on FBI agent and martial arts expert Phoenix Perry. Reminiscent of the writing style of James Patterson, Keith Lee Johnson writes short chapters that are packed with excitement and intrigue. The characters are fully developed and sharply focused, the dialogue is crisp and believable, and the plot is projected with such lightning speed that it is difficult to close the book until the last page is turned. In PRETENSES, the author also reveals an infrequently explored aspect of African-American history that adds an unexpected element to the villain's evil motivation for setting loose a mysterious and powerful serial killer, who challenges Phoenix to the core of her intellect and fighting spirit, causing the agent to suspect a mole in the fabric of her law enforcement organization. The final showdown between Phoenix and her nemesis is chilling and thrill-packed, in spite of the advance knowledge of the outcome provided by a prior reading of SUGAR AND SPICE. In fact, the reading of both novels would have been enhanced if the author had released PRETENSES first, and it would be interesting to learn his rationale for releasing the thrillers in reverse order. 
A11E4SSDIIBHZB 0060557540 July 24, 2004 12 20 2.0 Slow, From Start to Finish After almost a month, I finally was able to finish this novel. Except for occasional moments of intrigue, interspersed with episodes that evoked outrage, the plot just plodded along, and none of the characters, other than the institution of slavery itself, ever came to life. Moreover, the writing style was stilted and archaic, and the ending, which was supposed to pull everything together, did not fulfill its advertised promise. In fact, the conclusion was particularly disappointing, except that it brought an end to my mind-numbing boredom. 
A11E4SSDIIBHZB 0553801430 August 10, 2003 0 1 5.0 STILL THE KING OF IMAGINATION! I have read every published novel by Dean Koontz and continue to marvel at the depth of his imagination. BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is no exception, although, initially, it was burdened by labored and esoteric prose--so much so that, for a while, I thought I had ventured into a Toni Morrison novel. As usual, however, this author's wit and remarkable imagination prevailed, and allowed me to connect with the characters, and wonder at their amazing, albeit involuntarily induced, capabilities. The concept of "folding" will never mean the same to me again, and I am "much improved" by this wild experience. (Read and reviewed March 21, 2003) 
A11E8MA7DZ7WNU 0471346543 October 23, 2000 3 3 5.0 Volume 2 of my Healthy Cooking Bibles I bought this book after buying All-American Low-Fat and No-Fat Recipes by the same author. I am happy to say the results are just as delicious!!There are so many great recipes in this book. Some of my favoirtes are Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Veggies and Cheese, Pizza Cups, Cheeseburger Pie, and the Veg-All Seven Vegetable Mushroom Rice. The book is light on desserts, but on the up side there is an extensive salad and bread section. This book is invaluable to anyone with a busy lifestyle where a quck meal is essential and a healthy meal is desired. Well worth the cost! 
A11E8MA7DZ7WNU 0375504141 May 8, 2000 1 3 2.0 Ok For Beginners, But Not Those Who Just Want InspIration I have been on a weight loss program for about 2 months and bought this book because I thought it would give me some inspiration. Although Ms Molnar's story is inspirational, there isn't enough of it to make it worthwhile for someone who just wants motivation. However, if you are just begining and don't know how to go about setting up a diet and exercie plan, this book will give you some great ideas. The one feature I did enjoy was the reference section which lists web sites that will help you find events such as bike races, walks, and runs in your area. 
A11E8MA7DZ7WNU 6304286325 January 14, 2000 3 3 5.0 One Of My Very Favorite Movies! I LOVE this movie. It was the first vdeo I ever bought for myself and is one of the sweetest, most romantic, and funniest movies I've seen. DB Sweeney is gorgeous as the loveable, girl chasing,less than brilliant ex-hockey god, and Moira Kelly plays an excellent, evil, spoiled typical rich primadonna figure skater from Connecticut. Techncally, it is hard to believe a hockey player could be transformed into a figure skater, but view it with an open mind and you will fall in love with this movie too! 
A11EQ2TAGTPQDB 0911903968 April 3, 2006 2 2 5.0 Amazing epic of a classic Disney character Perhaps I'm a bit biased, since Scrooge McDuck is my favorite Disney character, but I found this to be one of the most captivating and amazing stories I have ever read in comic form. This comic tells the tale of Scrooge McDuck from his humble beginnings as a poor boy in Scotland with dreams of fortune and adventure. The comic follows Scrooge's exploits throughout the world, from meeting the Beagle Boys, encountering Flintheart Glomgold, founding the town of Duckburg, and meeting his nephews for the first time. It's a shame there aren't more backstories like this for other Disney characters. You'll enjoy this book if you're a fan of Scrooge, watched Ducktales as a kid, or just a fan of Disney in general. 
A11EQ2TAGTPQDB B00006L93A March 18, 2005 1 3 5.0 Well.. It's a 50's cartoon This is a 50's Japanese cartoon dubbed for American kids...in the 50's. I have to wonder if the dialogue was this ridiculous in the original Japanese. But then again, you have to release it this way because one of the great parts of the show is it's nostalgia factor. Granted, I was not alive in the 50's, but it gives me a TINY insight on what children of the 50's watched. Now if only they would release Astro Boy. All in all this is a great show, and try to get ahold of the 80's re-make if you can, because it's great like this show, but has a bit more of a serious side 
A11EQ2TAGTPQDB 0595300219 May 16, 2004 2 5 1.0 To the Author: Please kill yourself I see no purpose for your existance. Not one at all. You have no redeemable purpose for living. And that would also probably go the same for anyone who enjoys this crap you call a book. But then what do I know? I'm just a person with human feelings, and you're a writer who's basking in the total $10 of money you made from book sales. 
A11EQ2TAGTPQDB B000077VTA November 18, 2002 1 1 5.0 THE BEST ONE !!!!! This tape has the best episodes when Astro fights the robot king Pluto. Pluto, the first 1,000,000 horsepower robot challenges Astro, the amazing 100,000 horsepower robot to a duel that will claim his crown as the robot king. 
A11EVU318FTW32 B00005N7RG January 23, 2002 19 19 5.0 Excellent magazine! I have received Military History since mid-1996 and have not been disappointed. Each issue selects military history stories/tibits/essays/interviews from various periods of history (usually 4 to 5) and places them as the main part of the magazine followed by occasional further reading sections. In addition to the 4 to 5 main stories, Military History also includes one story/essay/tibit under each of the following headings: Intrigue, Personality (a selected personality in military history), Reviews (readers review books, movies, and computer games - usually only three reviews or less per magazine), Perspectives (provides incite into little known battles throughout history), Weapony (descriptions and details cover weapons ranging from little known to well known, from early BC to late AD), and finally Best Little Stories (unique and interesting stories covering a wide range of military history topics.) Military History also provides occasional interviews with persons who served in one or more of any of the modern day wars (Spanish Civil War to present.) Besides great stories, Military History also provides a web site in relation to About.com where readers can continue discusions from the magazine, answer daily quizes, see what happened this day in history, or see a daily picture. The Military History web site also provides readers with access to selected stories from other Primedia (publisher of MH) publications. Overall, Military History is an excellent magazine well worth the price Amazon charges for a one year subscription. Although you only get 6 issues, they are filled with well written and well researched essays (at least 80 pages worth.) Also, if one does not agree or would like to provide additional information to a particular story, Military History also publishes reader letters. Therefore, if you like reading a variety of military history books or would just like to know more about various events in military history, Military History (the magazine) is definitely worth your time and money. I am a subscriber for life! (Or, at least as long as it is published.) P.S. Once you become a subscriber Military History allows you to buy gift subscriptions for your friends at a greatly reduced price with your own renewal. I have found the gift subscriptions make great "anonymous" Christmas or late birthday gifts. 
A11EVU318FTW32 0137488726 December 6, 1999 3 3 5.0 A good book for students! As a 3rd year student interested in the computer field, I found this book extremely helpful in identifing which classes to enroll in and how to educate myself to be more competitive in the modern work world. It is nice to hear from leaders in the technology field giving advice to students on how to better educate themselves. I would recommend this book to any student who is interested in a "cybercareer." The book was easy to read and the little notes they posted out to the side to offset certain important points were helpfull and easy to follow. It was much similar to a textbook in that students can use the index and read only the chapters or topics that apply to them. While technology is changing and some topics in this book will become out-of-date, there are still some good fundamentals to be gleaned from this book. 
A11EXFO14WEJM1 B0001ELYOQ July 7, 2004 15 17 3.0 Returned it with reluctance... I bought this camera to replace our 7 year old VHS-C camcorder. It had most of the features that I was looking for: MiniDV, Optical zoom greater than 10x, batterly life greater than 1 hour, LCD geater than 2.5", built-in light, and memory card for digital pictures. I returned it for one main reason- video quality is equal to that of my current camcorder. It gets worse under certain circumstances. (Disabling DIS didn't improve the picture quality.) Every feature that was attractive to me turned out to be inadequate. Large LCD screen, but the image is not pleasing. Built-in video light barely lights closeby objects. No facility (shoe) to place external light or flash. Still images are another big disappointment. I realize that I shouldn't expect great still pictures from a camcorder, but I don't think they should come out this blurry, dull, and hazy. Memory card slot can accept various different media (SD, memory stick, etc.) - I think this is a very neat feature. I was amazed by Nite Pix feature. Yes, you can record video in absolute darkness, but the objects have to be within close proximity (6 feet or so). Fading option (between footages) is extremely disappointing. You have to keep the fade button pushed until the image fades out, then push the standby button, and then release the fade button. You have to do the same when you start recording again. Completely manual operation. We own many Samsung products and I am very satisfied with each one of them. This product is not going to change my opinion on Samsung. 
A11F0ECHMYDWIN 0716794624 July 17, 2005 0 0 3.0 Good overview of discovery, Government intervention Steve Fiffer's "Tyrannosaurus Sue" is an interesting tale of the discovery of the most complete T-Rex skeleton found up to that point, and the bizarre battle that ensued over the ownership of the find. The book provides some insight into the world of paleontology (especially the pitfalls of searching on property where boundary lines aren't clear), and details a rather maddening tale of government intervention. I would have enjoyed more discussion of paleontology, but I understand that that wasn't the purpose of this particular work. Fiffer's writing style is straightforward to the point of being a bit dry at points, but it's well suited to describing the legal and political manipulations of the story. An interesting book that will spur interest in reading more about its subject matter. 
A11F0ECHMYDWIN B00004X03W March 26, 2005 4 4 5.0 Fantastic Acoustic Album John Hiatt's music has always been a little difficult to categorize, and this may be one reason he hasn't received the attention he deserves over the course of his career. If Hiatt was overly concerned about this, he wouldn't have released "Crossing Muddy Waters", with its unusual blend of musical styles. Fortunately, Hiatt seems to value quality work over huge commercial success, or we'd have missed out on a spectacular album. I don't think there's a weak track on the CD, from the driving opening track "Lincoln Town" and the haunting title track, to the uplifting final track "Before I Go". The acoustic "format" isn't that far removed from some of Hiatt's other work, but it is somewhat of a switch, and Hiatt handled it masterfully. One of the best albums from a guy who always delivers! 
A11F0ECHMYDWIN B00005JLRQ January 30, 2005 2 2 4.0 Worthy Sequel to an entertaining film "Shanghai Noon" was a surprisingly entertaining film - surprising because of many elements that should have been distracting but somehow worked. "Shanghai Knights" follows the same formula to a large extent, and the result is a film that is at least as funny and entertaining as the original. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan is still present. Wilson is again funny as the goofy half of the team, and Chan's martial arts displays are as mesmerizing as ever. The writing is clever (setting the sequel in London was quite creative), and the supporting cast is solid, in some cases making the most of some limited screen time. "Shanghai Knights" is at least as entertaining as the original, and I hope the rumors of a third entry in the series (entitled "Shanghai Dawn", by some accounts) are true. 
A11F0ECHMYDWIN 907167634X January 1, 2005 2 2 4.0 Faith Factors and Free Speech There seems to be a movement in the US to silence any political opinions that are informed in any way by religious faith, especially if that faith is a Conservative version of Christianity. Those who would silence people of faith from speaking out politically may be a very small group, but their numbers may be growing, and they will certainly become more vocal as President Bush begins his second term. This is one of the key issues Reed addresses in "Politically Incorrect", a book that is timely in many regards even though it was written about a decade ago. Reed points out that the great social movements of the last few centuries had a strong religious dimension, and in many cases were spearheaded by persons motivated by their religious faith. Reed goes on to lay down a common sense prescription for some of the ills he sees in society, and effectively argues that the right to pursue these goals should not be denied to people simply because they are guided in part by religious faith. Some humor inserted somehow would have been welcome in Reed's work, but his book is otherwise a solid effort worthy of the reader's time. 
A11F6QQ2J1H6K9 B00009XS6D August 24, 2004 1 1 4.0 really fun for the money I'm a little lost why everyone is bashing the heck out of this title. It only costs $10 folks, and its worth it. The game is fun and simple. There are plenty of different modes to play and lots of things to unlock. Basic play is rather easy. Despite what people say, there are differences in the cars from year to year. for example, a 67 will out run a 63 in a straight line. If the cars were all the same, that would be impossible. The older cars have awful brakes just like they did in real life. The c5 a re fluid and graceful and the c4's are chunky and tempermental, just like in real life. (i've owned a c3, c4 and c5) The graphics are pretty nice, and the tunnel vision at 100mph is a nice effect. The courses are pretty good (although there are some that i dont care for). Dislikes: 2 player mode makes you race the same era of cars. dirt and pavement traction is fairly similar. physics aren't too real, but close enough for fun. The game could be imporved upon without a doubt, and if it was I'd pay the normal $50, but in this case i only paid $10, and I feel that the game is a great value for the money. I dont need a clone of GT3 or NFS or anything else. i have those and if i want to play them i will. lastly, the most humorous defect i've found so far: When in 2 player mode, if player 1 wins, then player 2's car will not have any engine noise. You still hear tires screaching and wind noise though. rather funny. 
A11F6QQ2J1H6K9 B00005JLRT July 3, 2003 1 3 5.0 Awsome Finally a Star Trek film with a bit of ooomph! Ok its not the only good one, but Nemesis is a great one. The space combat is great, the story has a couple predictable but interesting plot twists one sort of resembling ST 2 and 3. There are a few areas where the plot seems to not make sense, or that the characters make or dont make logical decisions or reactions, but if you can suspend your disbelief enough to over look them, the story will grab you and suck you in. 
A11FEJJQQ3QHBM B00003CXKS January 20, 2004 2 4 5.0 This movie invites you to have a wonderful film experience I really loved this movie. After watching this movie, I came to the conclusion that I just couldn't watch it another time. Not because it's a bad movie, but because of how emotionally draining it is (reading the reviews, I've found I'm not the only one who reacted this way to the movie). The acting was so good and the movie was produced so well that it pulled me in completely. I was completely drained after this movie. I don't cry when watching movies, but I was balling after seeing this one. Even after stepping away from the film, I watched it about two weeks ago; I almost come to tears just talking about it. I couldn't even explain the movie to anyone because I would begin to cry. Bjork does such a great job of bringing Selma alive that you fall in love with her during the course of the movie. You feel like a friend that is standing by. Because of that, the movie was so emotional for me. I couldn't stand to see what my friend was going through. The story of the movie was great. They really thought it through because when I stepped away from the film, it just continued to make more and more sense to me. The story was strong, and the writing was excellent. It was so innovative how they incorporated music into this movie. The musical aspect of it just added more depth and personality to Selma. I felt like I was entering a portal into Selma's mind when the music began. The musical aspect of it wasn't cheesy at all; it was so creative. The acting was superb. It was like every actor in this movie fully became his or her character. I'm a huge fan of Bjork, but during the movie I didn't remember I was watching Bjork star in a movie at all; I was just watching Selma. The entire supporting cast did an excellent job of portraying his or her character. Talk about complete suspension of disbelief. I was in the movie entirely; felt the movie's emotions completely. The direction was solid and unique. The way they chose to shoot the movie was very, very neat. The camera angles and editing were really original. I honestly credit the direction and movie style for creating that portal into that world. Most movies make you feel like you are watching a movie, but this movie made you feel like you entered that world at that time. I would highly recommend this film to everyone. This movie allowed me to have a truly wonderful movie experience. This is only one of two movies that touched me so deep, that stayed with me long after the show was over, that drew me in so completely. I must say this, when I first started watching the movie I was singing a completely different tune. During the beginning of the movie, I didn't realize that everything I was seeing was very much in tune with the whole story line (I didn't know anything about this movie when I got it). Then I came to this site, read some good reviews, and decided to go ahead and finish this movie. So don't be discouraged with it too quickly. Give it a chance, and most likely you'll find the treasure that I did. fatti 
A11FEJJQQ3QHBM 6304127278 September 30, 2001 4 8 5.0 In Loving Memory of Dr. Katz...Professional Therapist. This, and the rest of the video collection, is all we Dr. Katz fans can hold onto. As far as I'm concerned, this was the best show on TV (along with Martin). I still can't believe Dr. Katz was cancelled, even syndication! This squiggly vision show will have you laughing until your belly hurts! Watching Dr. Katz's daily life is HILARIOUS! All of Dr. Katz's patients are professional comics (i.e. Dave Chappelle, Ray Ramono, Ben Stiller, Jon Stewart, Kathy Griffin, and more!). It makes the show even funnier! Synopsis of Main Characters: Dr. Katz- Meek, soft spoken, divorcee who is a professional therapist. He is often walked all over by his secretary, son, and good buddy. Ben Katz- Product of Dr. Katz's failed marriage, Ben is a 25-year-old boy (hence the word BOY) who still lives with his father in a 2-bedroom apartment in the city. Ben is VERY dependent, and has no plans (or at least realistic ones) of doing anything for himself. He has never had a job; the closest thing was his mission to breed Vietnamese pot bellied pigs from home! The only thing stopping him was the $3,000.00 he would have to pay per pig; he had a great time trying to talk daddikins into that one. All he does is walk around the house in non-matching socks, a t-shirt, and his tidy whiteys! Oh, and Mr. Bulley; he always has to have Mr. Bulley (a stuffed bull). Laura- She is the sassy secretary of Dr. Katz that doesn't seem to take anyone seriously. Although she does nothing in the (helpful) office, it's more like she is running it. She is also the one to credit for their creative filing system: "Nuttier than a fruit cake, nutty as a fruit cake, not as nutty as a fruit cake"! She is also the sparkle in Ben's eye; Benny Boy has a great big crush on Laura! Stan- He reminds me so much of Larry on Three's Company! He is a late 30's early 40 something year old bachelor that thinks he is the total ladies man. He sells real estate by day, and picks up the ladies by night (or so he thinks!). He is always feeding Dr. Katz with bad advice on women. He even drinks at a place that is very similar to the Regal Beagle that Larry and Jack drank at. With these four, and all the supporting characters of the show, that is why this is one of the best shows my Magnavox has ever seen! Even without the professional comics The Katz Man, Ben, Laura, and Stan make the show worth watching! I would recommend this, and all Dr. Katz videos to everyone! ... 
A11FEJJQQ3QHBM B000000WFF June 6, 2001 0 1 5.0 Wonderfully Spicy This is such a fun album. I love all the tid bits they include about individuality, girl power, and believing in yourself. A wonderful album for anyone. I am typically a fan of Tri State Hardcore, Metal, Hip Hop, and Jazz...not your typical Spice Girls fan, but I do think this is a WONDERFUL album. Thanks. fatti 
A11FV8K9NJB5R9 B00001SIEW May 27, 2000 0 0 5.0 I'll never be the same again In a musical climate dominated by prefab R&B, or bands trying to cross Pearl Jam and the Eagles, or anonymous SoCal post-punkers, Guster is a breath of fresh air. This two-guitars-and-congas combo brings just a touch of worldbeat to their minimalist folk-pop. "Lost and Gone Forever" wanders through a lot of stylistic ground, from straight-on rockers like "Barrel of a Gun" to the calypso-tinged "Fa Fa (Never Be the Same Again)". This album is full of catchy, well-crafted and well-performed songs with an irresistable rhythmic drive. I've never seen them live, but I can only imagine they'd be even better in person. Recommended to anybody who thinks there isn't anything new going on in music these days. 
A11FV8K9NJB5R9 0834115034 December 27, 1999 0 0 4.0 A pretty good book, worth the price This book is useful for somebody who's had zero exposure to rural culture. But, like most works in the field of rural ministry, it doesn't go deeply enough into the particulars of rural sociology, and it ignores the economic aspects of agriculture. It's not a bad book, but the definitive guide for beginning rural ministers has yet to be written. 
A11FWG3GBQC6SP 0684811073 December 1, 2002 1 4 5.0 The Greatest American Adventure Ambrose began with some background on Lewis and Jefferson, the political circumstances of the time and how the expedition was organized. He then told the tale of the trip itself and finished with a short aftermath touching on Lewis and Clark's post-expedition activities, Lewis' untimely death and Jefferson's frustrations at not having a final narrative of the journals. So many great stories here: the exedition's wintering in North Dakota (at 45 below zero); their close calls with grizzly bears and near starvation in the Bitterroots; their many interactions with the Indians; Lewis' discovery of the Great Falls of the Missouri; the first vote by a woman and a black man on the North American continent; Lewis accidently getting shot by one of his own men; etc., etc. Too many vignettes to list and Ambrose brings each one to life. You can smell the smoke of their fires and feel the cactus punching through the soles of their elkskin mocossins. The maps are first class too. I appreciated the clear layout of the topography showing where these events took place with respect to modern day cities and roads and have used them to follow parts of the Lewis & Clark Trail. The fact that the Lewis & Clark Expedition was a passion of Stephen Ambrose really came through in this great book and made for some exhilerating writing. (Ambrose started camping along the trail in 1976 and maintained a home in Helena, MT.) There are times I literally got goosebumps while reading and closed the book with a deep sigh, prompting my wife to ask, "What?!" Fascinating - educational - very readable. Undaunted Courage gets my highest recommendation. 
A11G7D7YDR5J82 B00000J6BR December 8, 2000 4 4 4.0 A superb effort for VH This cd has the depth and meaning that most artists never seem to reach in their careers. Their style and sound is somehow similar to R.E.M. But somehow it leaves you more inspired than R.E.M. The Explosive entry of We Are, sets the cd off right. Then the frustration of You're A God hooks you and makes you want more. That leads right into Everything You Want. If you haven't heard it by now, then you are probably very lucky. It was overplayed, like most songs, but if you look past that then it is a great song about failed romance. The real gem of this cd is next. Best I Ever Had (Grey Sky Morning). The slow sad melodic voice of Matt Scannel. You Say is another great song. Finding Me is another great song that catches the mood. Another favorite of mine is All Of You. It seems to almost catch you off guard but it sounds great. Overall, A great cd that merits a good listen 
A11G7D7YDR5J82 B00002Z88G April 26, 2000 3 3 5.0 Could you expect anything less If I could sum up the whole cd in two words they would be deep and profound. This cd just rocks. "Never Let You Go" (If it hasn't already made your toe start tapping) is a great song that most people have heard. Then there is their new release "10 Days Late" which is also a great song. Other good songs include Anything, 1000 Julys, An Ode to Maybe, Darkness and Darwin. The most profound and by far the best song on the album is Wounded. The lyrics alone are powerful but add music and it is work of art. The thing that I don't like is that their record company wouldn't let them put the original version of Slow Motion, which is kinda explicit, but It is so true. A great overall cd 
A11GIIHZ6Y7UU1 0765314711 December 12, 2005 0 0 4.0 Good first attempt with some minor flaws I really enjoyed this book, although I don't think it deserves some of the rave reviews. The material was fresh and funny, but there were a couple of problems with the style of writing. The editor needs to do a little more work. Some of the grammatical mistakes were distracting. The style of writing was also variable. Sometimes it was very enjoyable. Alot of the time it was uncomfortable, reading more like a movie script than a novel, with the "set" described in painful detail. Taking into account that this is a debut novel, it was really a great book. I wouldn't put it at the same level as Christopher Moore or Tanya Huff as some of the other reviewers did, but I'll look for more books from this author. If the freshness and humor continue and the writing improves with practice, A. Lee Martinez could become one of my favorites. 
A11GIIHZ6Y7UU1 0380732335 May 2, 2005 2 4 1.0 Not worth finishing I had high hopes when I started this book, but it quickly became tedious. Too many characters, too many disjointed scenes, not enough plot. After getting half way through the book, it just doesn't seem worth the time to finish it. Given the grammatical errors in the book, I was surprised to find out that the author was a reporter, and even more so to find that he had been an editor. Stick with Hiaassen. If you want good, zany writing in a different setting, try Christopher Moore (Practical Demon Keeping et al). 
A11GIW0PXL897L B0000ACOXK October 13, 2004 23 25 5.0 A very handy companion to Scrabble! A Must Have ! If you love Scrabble, you have to try out this Scrabble electronic dictionary. It's wonderful....it makes playing the game much easier. Even a tabbed (book) dictionary isn't as good as this - just type in the word - press enter - you instantly see if it's a word or not, and if so, it'll define it. If it takes forever to tell you - that means it's not a word and it's finding the nearest word to your entry. There's some games and extras on it, but it does the job wonderfully!! I didn't pay retail, I got it on sale which I'm sure I'll never see again, but it's worth it even at retail price! Very easy to use and your friends and family will thank you for it! It definitely saves time during the game!! 
A11GIW0PXL897L B00000JGRT December 1, 2003 8 8 5.0 Great Ice Cream Maker - Unbeatable Price! I just bought this ice cream maker (Cuisinart ICE-20) and it was a nice surprise to see the ice cream it produces! I got the promotional deal that just ended where you get a free $30 1.5 qt. replacment bowl - what a steal! & Free shipping, how can you go wrong!? This is how the ice cream making process works plain and simple: 1.) freeze the freezer bowl for a minimum of 8 hours, the longer you freeze it the better. I'd say 24 hours would be best. The more frozen and cold the bowl is the better ice cream you'll get. 2.) When the bowl's completely frozen (shake it and it should be silent), start your ice cream mixture preparation. It usually takes 5 minutes to make the mixture (of course it's going to be liquid - it usually includes sugar, heavy cream, milk, vanilla etc). 3.) Take the frozen bowl out of your freezer, put it on the ice cream maker, insert the handle/scraper, turn on the machine, put your mixture in the machine, and put a timer on or make note of the time. 25-30 minutes later your ice cream will be ready. If you wanted to add nuts, fruit etc, you do that in the last 5 minutes. Pros: Easy to use, easy to clean, no ice/salt required (too messy!), quickly makes ice cream after bowl is frozen, great tasting ice cream, you know you're not eating nasty preservaties etc, easy to make at home when you need it (always keep these staple ingredients on hand though!) Cons: You really can't be in a rush when you make ice cream, something we early figured out. The bowl really has to be completely frozen, as eager as you may be, it just won't work if you do it to early AND it'll waste your ingredients. Also, the ice cream comes out not as hard as your typical ice cream from the store (just freeze the ice cream - more waiting, yes!) for 2 to 3 hours and it'll be just like your typical ice cream (this isn't a con of the machine, it's more a con of store bought ice cream and how they add too many preservatives). You really need 2 freezer bowls if you're making ice cream often. Keep one frozen while the other one's in use or being washed. Another con - recently tried the chocolate fudgesicle ice cream recipe they give you - total flop. Stick to the recipes under "basic ice cream" for best results. Slushies turned out well, but next time I'll add sugar. I guess those 7-11 slushies have a ton of sugar in them! Also, be prepared to buy an ice cream recipe book, as the manual only includes a dozen or so recipes. If you have egg allergies, make sure you don't try the decadent ice cream recipes - they normally include eggs! So far our ice cream has turned out great - best of all "Strawberry", and we tried Regular coke slushies (you can't use diet/sugar free soda)...that also turned out well. Overall, GREAT buy at a great price! If there's a promotion going on that gives you a free freezer bowl, MAKE SURE YOU GET IT, read the entire page! Good luck and happy ice cream making! :-) 
A11GM9T45T7DDL 6305313687 November 1, 2003 4 6 4.0 this movie this movie was written by a certain david mckenna. he grew up and went to my high school together. a couple of years ago i had a chance to talk to him after a very chance encounter in santa monica. dave explained that his script was completely rewritten after he sold the rights to it. the original ending was the most important section of the film and it was completely altered. the original script calls for a accidental murder of the character danny, and a more thoughtful exposition of the thesis of the film, which is principally about fear and how fear shapes our societies, and a small view into how this might come about. dave explained that the edward norton "skinhead" character's realization of ignorance and fear was much more fully and subtley developed than in the final cut. this is unfortunate, and i think that dave's original script would have made a more meaningful movie. the idea of portraying a charasmatic white power neo-nazi is absolutely controversial, but in analysing the movie ( even the final product ) i think it is very clear that the "logic" behind nazi theories shown is extremely faulty. in fact, the inspiration for "derek" to embrace these ideas is absolutely linked to his personal and emotional experiences and not his logical mind. if you want to judge for yourself, watch the film closely! all in all, this film was well directed, and in my opinion very well acted. certain parts could have been made more realistic, like the basketball sequence. (ed norton is not a basketball good player by any standards...but that is trivial). this is a movie that interested me, and if you watch it remember that it was not intended by the writer to play out exactly as it does. 
A11GM9T45T7DDL B00007JXWX October 2, 2003 4 5 3.0 comments catcher in the rye? It has been mentioned that this movie is based on the Catcher in the Rye. Afterall they are both stories that revolve around a disillusioned prep school youth. However, this movie is not a film version of the book. Holden Caulfield's character is desribed foremost by his relationships and his thoughts on the people around him. He manages to find the fleshy side of all of his aquantances, even those who he despises. His commentary is thourough and critical, yet remains sympathetic . Igby is desribed by his relationships as well, but with these interactions we almost only see his pessimism and sarcasm. His critiques are plentiful, but we never really see him as any more than a young boy carelessly lashing out at a world that is, by his standards, so "f---ing hypocritical".He only seems to care about others when he is interested in having sex with them. And whereas Holden is a character plagued by paralysis and pensiveness, Igby is only too willing to sell drugs,run away, get expelled, and sleep with his uncle's mistress. In this way, the movie and book are different, and in this way, the book is far superior. cast and acting The cast that was assembled for this movie is for the most part famous. The casting of was very appropriate, and impressive given the film's small budget. The movie is Kieran Culkin's vehichle and he plays the rich boy smartass very well. The rest of the supporting cast are impressive and charismatic, especially jared harris and jeff goldblum. Ryan Phillipe seems to be perfectly well suited to the WASP character that he has already played in cruel intentions. The movie has some charm and its moments. The conversational sparring between Culkin and Harris in the New York, using a yoga ball as an illustrating prop was interesting and funny (Money bags... take me away!) . The absurd shrink at "Clipped Wings" is a fun comic interlude, and seems to be improvised. Part of the fun of the movie is that, although it centers around pretentious people, It doesnt really take itself too seriously. There isn't revelatory. None of the characters change (except for dying) and the message seems to be less than clear. Igby is not a sympathetic character and it is hard to be sympathetic for him. The fun of watching the movie is seeing an ensemble of well knowns playing so succinctly in an entertaining indepndent film. 
A11GN3THJ197XN 0385336667 February 21, 2004 0 0 4.0 Well plotted, with nice plot reversals This is the seventh and latest in Lee Child's Jack Reacher series. Reacher is a former military cop who reached the rank of major before before let go in the downsizing of the '90s. He has a total indifference to possessions, and travels around the country staying in cheap hotels. The Reacher novels are successful because Child is usually good at plot twists and reversals. Although Reacher's background is in police work, much more emphasis is put on his combat skills, which seem to equal Delta Force. Persuader begins quickly with a kidnapping and shootout. Reacher quickly finds himself infiltrating a smuggler's household where he will be killed if discovered. Child pushes the limits of plausibility at times -- Reacher seems to be without fear and sticks around when a more sensible person would run -- but stays within the limits enough that I could enjoy the book. Persuader plays to Child's strengths in that the plot keeps moving quickly enough and throws the reader off guard that the momentum covers up any small errors. If you are looking for a thriller with plenty of action, this book does the job nicely. 
A11GN3THJ197XN 0399150439 May 15, 2003 5 5 4.0 Solid entry in the Prey series Naked Prey is the latest of John Sandford's Lucas Davenport series. Davenport has a new job for the governor that sends him off to a remote area of Minnesota to investigate a suspected lynching of a black man and white woman. One unfortunate result of the setting is that few of the regular series characters are in this book, and with one exception, those that appear do so briefly. Sandford breaks with the formula that has so often served him well in the past -- Davenport versus a killer (who may or may not be identified to the reader) with each making move and counter-move against one another. Here, Davenport actually solves the initial crime early in the book. However, the samll town near the crime scene has a lot of secrets that continue to propel the plot. At times, the characters are driven by mistakes and misunderstandings as to what is actually happening -- which is close to the way things happen in real life. Sandford also has a good feel for Midwestern characters and the way they talk. The dialog is sharp throughout the book. If you like the Prey series, you will want to read this book. I don't rank it at the top of the series because of some plot holes that occur early in the book. Without giving the plot away, the first killing occurs because the killer has learned the names of his victims from someone else who he has killed before the book has begun. How he found this person, who should have been otherwise unknown to him, is not clear. Also,this person gives him only some but not all of the names of the people he would be looking for -- again, no explanation. However, Sandford keeps the plot moving quickly enough that this problem is quickly forgotten. Too bad that it is a year before another Prey novel comes out. 
A11GN3THJ197XN 0805070583 April 15, 2002 5 6 4.0 Engaging combination of coming-of-age novel and mystery Most readers spent much of their childhood reading mystery stories written for children, in which children or teenagers caught spies or bank robbers by carefully noting their comings and goings and making brillant deductions. Michael Frayn has taken this formula and turned it on its head in Spies. Set during World War II, Spies is the story of what happens the narrator and his best (and only) friend begin observing the friend's mother based on the friend's idiotic notion that she is a German spy. Just like their counterparts in the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew (there must be British equivalents), they start going through her things, and observing her comings and goings. Unfortunately, while she is of course not a spy, she is up to something, and the boys' investigation uncovers secrets that the adults are trying to keep quiet. The story is told in flashback, with the narrator as an old man looking back at his youth. However, he tries to report things as he remembers them. This allows the narrator to realize things the narrator doesn't, such as the flaws in some of the characters. It will also many readers to anticipate events before they occur. Nevertheless, there are a number of twists to the plot that will surprise the most. Some will find the ending, in which we learn of things hinted at in the main story, but so peripheral to the plot as not to enage our attention, too clever and unnecessary. As I like suprises, I enjoyed the final summing up. Frayn, who has written on a wide range of subjects, has succeeded here. 
A11GN3THJ197XN 0520071662 October 24, 2001 5 6 4.0 Well researched and thorough biography of Alexander Alexander the Great is not someone about whom it could be said that the definitive biography has been writtern. The difficulty is not just that a biographer is dealing with a figure who lived thousands of years ago, and whose original biographies have been lost. The larger problem is that our view of the world and life is quite different than it was in the time of Alexander and those who followed him. To be a great military leader is no longer viewed as the highest possible achievement, and Alexander's ambition, which was Homeric in scope, no longer seems as admirable as it did in the past. Thus, I think that Green sometimes takes an excessively unfavorable view of Alexander. On the other hand, Green is one of the leading classcial scholars in the world, and he undoubtedly knows what he is doing better than someone like myself. The strengths of this biography is that it is thoroughly researched, does not engage in speculation to fill in the gaps that exist, and is particularly strong on Alexander's battles. One can question whether Alexander was the greatest general of all time -- after all, it was a very different thing to command an army in classical times where a general was expected to be in the forefront of the action, as opposed to the battles of Napoleon, where conduct like Alexander's would have gotten Napoleon killed in short order. Nevertheless, Green's historical judgments seem sound. If you find this book interesting, you will not want to stop here. On the other hand, it is an excellent place to start, and is the best recent biography of Alexander. 
A11GN3THJ197XN 0571099130 October 16, 2001 11 11 5.0 One of the great books about World War I. World War I had a far greater impact on Britain than the US for the obvious reasons that they were in the war for over four years and suffered horrific casualties. The literature produced by that war made a sharp break from what came before, which reflected the feeling in the country that the war had irrevocably changed life in Britain. This is well illustrated in Siegfreid Sassoon's "The Complete Memoirs of George Sherston," a fictional version of his own experiences. The first part covers Sherston's pre-war life, with his obsession with fox-hunting. This is so well written that you will enjoy it even if you don't have the least interest in the subject. The next section, "Memoirs of an Infantry Officer" covers his experiences in World War I, during he is highly decorated. The horrors of the war, which many of Sassoon's class thought would be a great adventure, are accurately portrayed. Eventually he becomes disillusioned with the war, and writes a letter denouncing it that could have led to his court-martial. A close friend (Robert Graves in real life) gets him classified as having a mental disorder and he is sent off to a hospital to recuperate. This book is deeply moving and is one of a handful of books that changed the way that the English-speaking world views war. Sassoon's writing style is plain on the surface, but its plainness makes the emotional impact all the greater. 
A11GN3THJ197XN 0553268880 October 12, 2001 4 13 1.0 It is hard to understand the success of this book. All novels require a suspension of disbelief, but this one was too much for me. It uses the hoary device of Freudian analysis as a means of structuring the story. The great traumatic secret that this analysis eventually uncovers is so over the top as to be funny rather than horrifying; one would like to know what Flannery O'Connor would have thought of it. As much as others love this book, for me almost everything in it rang false. 
A11GN3THJ197XN 0826453465 September 7, 2001 4 5 4.0 Larkin essays on jazz are insightful For many years, Philip Larkin wrote reviews and essays on Jazz. He fell in love with the music as a young man. This love might seem odd, because Jazz is a distinctly American form of music (and Larkin almost never travelled abroad and never to America) and it is also dominated by African-Americans (Larkin has unkind things to say about minorities in his Collected Letters). Nevertheless, Larkin found in the music of Armstrong, Ellington, Basie, and others a joy that was missing from much of the rest of his life. One warning for serious Jazz fans -- for Larkin, the downfall of Jazz began with Charlie Parker. He had no interest in Parker, Mingus, Miles Davis, or almost anyone who recorded after the later 40's. In fact, he lumped Charlie Parker with Ezra Pound and Pablo Picasso as person with reputations as great artists, but whom he felt had a terrible effect on their art. In some ways, this book tells you as much about Larkin as Jazz. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm he had for Jazz, and his skill as an essayist make this an enjoyable book. 
A11GN3THJ197XN 0670807737 September 3, 2001 6 7 4.0 A controversial but well written book Remember all the World War II movies where a handful of American or British soldiers mow down scores of German soldiers because the Allies are smarter? Ellis' argument here is that the Allies won the war not by being smarter that than the Germans but by outproducing them in war material by a huge margin. Ellis produces a substantial amount of evidence to support his claims. For example, the famous Luftwaffe bombing of London in 1940 cannot compare to the tremendous number of bombs dropped by the Allies on Berlin. Part of the reason for discrepancy in production is that the Allies, as stable democracies, were quicker to put their economies on a war footing. Unfortunately, the innovations they used to increase production beyond levels previously believed possible did not extend to military tactics. The result were higher casualties and a longer war than might have othewise been the case. 
A11GOF2RE72B54 0679449124 April 23, 2000 1 1 5.0 Hypnotic experience Having read Michael Ondaatje's work, I am a bit predisposed to enjoy it, but my anticipation did not prepare me for the luscious experience of listening to this work on tape. Mr. Ondaatje's voice, soft, lilting and hypnotic, was a fabulous presentation for his lyrical writing. I listened to this work on tape in the car, and had to pull off the side of the road, so that I could rewind and relisten to several parts. 
A11GU5Z86KUYNC B00022VPO6 December 20, 2005 1 1 5.0 Wonderful, light, rose fragrance Very light and romantic. A true tea rose fragrance. Attractively packaged. A perfect gift for friends or for yourself. 
A11GU5Z86KUYNC 0743463897 December 20, 2004 0 0 4.0 ONE OF LYNN HIGHTOWER'S BEST Three things I look for in a mystery. 1. Good writing, 2. unique plot, 3. interesting characters. This has all three. This was a stay up late to finish book. Looking forward to her next. 
A11GU5Z86KUYNC 0449001598 January 23, 1999 3 3 5.0 My two favorite things, a good mystery and a good dog. What a great surpires to find a good mystery that includes a quirky pet psychologist, lots of lovable dogs and an odd combination of murder suspects. Add to this the author's delightful sense of humor and you have a very enjoyable read. I can't wait for Leslie O'Kane's next book in this series. 
A11H2YWJ0RCMPX 0380003562 February 7, 2001 0 0 4.0 Quintessential Assimov In his usual witty, blunt and almost arrogant style, Asimov ponders such things as math, physics and the stuff of life. This little book provides an interesting overview of several sciences while attempting to challenge your mind to think logically and clearly (a hallmark of much of Asimov's writing). I love my copy and have earmarked several pages for re-reading. Warning, if you don't love science as a process, this book may not be for you. 
A11H2YWJ0RCMPX 0030583373 February 7, 2001 2 2 5.0 Great Little Textbook for PR Students O.K. the book may not be that little, but is an excellent resource for beginning PR students and professionals. It covers all the basicis from a definition of PR to how to do PR well to how to perform the nuts & bolts tasks of PR. It is also very readable. It may not be a cuddle-up-in-bed book, but it does the job in a much less painful way than most textbooks! (P.S. Grunig is an excellent teacher and explains PR concepts in an approachable manner.) 
A11H2YWJ0RCMPX 0609804057 February 2, 2001 9 9 5.0 Excellent Intro to Yoga & Yoga Zone I am a rank beginner when it comes to yoga--I didn't even think about it until last year and just started taking classes this year (2001). This book provides a good introduction to Yoga Zone's brand of yoga--a mixture of three types: Hatha yoga (a physical form of yoga), Tantra yoga (a more philosophical form of yoga) and Ayurveda yoga (a healing form of yoga). The section on breath and breathing (an important part of yoga and life in general) is great and the descriptions and illustrations of the various postures are quite helpful (and take up the bulk of the book). Finger and Bingham have a very personable style of writing that makes it seem you are being spoken to, rather than reading a book. 
A11HB3LYLIQNZP 187906605X January 2, 2006 0 0 3.0 Reminiscences rather than a Biography My wife was reading a Russian Biography on Saint John of Shanghai & San Francisco & told me a few things about the Saint. There were a few issues that I needed to verify in English & I knew I had the above title book in my ever growing book closet. Instead of a standard Biography with a basic outline of the person's historical life, this book contain the following: Part I - Reminiscences 18 Reminiscences from layman, Priests, Bishops, etc...each starting & ending with their own personal experiences with the Saint when he was alive. This created no true starting point, nor a general historical flow. Some information was repeated. After reading, it's up to the reader to paste together the Saint's life. Part II - Testimonies Concerning Archbishop John's Power of Prayer There is about 50 pages of people testimonies about Saint John's power of prayer after his death in 1966. I can personally give praise to Saint John when he revealed his help to my wife & I while we were vacationing & visiting his relics in San Francisco around Aug 2004. Part III - Sermons & Homilies These are 22 written sermons that Saint John gave during his life time. Some sermons are about the Church seasons: Lent & Theophany for example. Some sermons are on certain biblical passages: "In the Beginning was the Word...". Other sermons are about famous Russians: "The Tsar-Martyr Nicholas" or about the Russian exiles: "Russia". Part IV - Decrees & Exhortations Issued by Archbishop John As a Bishop, Saint John had to make Decrees about how the Church should run or how people should live, help, or understand Christian Orthodoxy. Appendix A Troparion to the Saint & a Report of the Examination of Saint's Holy Remains Over all a good book to read, but if your looking for a biography, this book should be used as a back-up reference. 
A11HB3LYLIQNZP B00000JN1X April 16, 2003 6 6 5.0 Where was I in 1992? I missed one of the most fantastic concerts ever, but at least I have the DVD to playback many times through many years of inmate enjoyment. No, not inmate as in reaching out, but inmate has in feeling the music completely. Rickie Lee delivers songs with no strings attach. No, you wont see her float through the air or wear outrageous cloths like Sarah Brightman does in "La Luna", or get pass around the audience like Peter Gabriel. The DVD starts in her dressing room, Rickie is sitting by a mirror putting on the last of her make-up, slips on a shirt, & walks out into a simple well lighted stage with a table for a foreground & a window frame for a background. The back up band are all professional, dressed simple, but play the music with such perfection, at times sounding like they are losing it, but no, its a multi layered time change. WOW!!! Most songs are written by Rickie, others are jazz standards, & one song was written by her father. The ultimate section is when she takes off her shirt & plays the piano with the tunes: "Coolsville" & "We Belong Together". The song "Coolsville" ends with the words "Common, I will take you back...I take you back..." & Rickie holds her hand out to the audience, waving them in, & then making a fist. Slowly she stops the song & sits in darkness with the saddest face...then she giggles & the audience goes crazy...what a moment. This is a great DVD 
A11HB3LYLIQNZP 0300083289 April 3, 2003 12 22 5.0 The Easiest to Read & Most Interesting Heidegger Book What a great book. I may of read about 4 to 5 Martin Heidegger books & this book flowed because it was more easy to read. Well, the first part of the book was easy, got a little lost in the "Being As Thinking" section. Heidegger's philosophy, minus the so-called "Certain Influences", helped me give up my Platonic ways of thinking. Heidegger starts off trying to ask the most basic axiom "Why are there BEINGs at all instead of Nothing" goes through a brief history of the main words, tears the words & main question apart, & puts the words & question back together again in a more "Primate", "Basic", or "Historical" understanding. Then he explains how BEING turns into BECOMING (how things change), APPEARANCE (how things influence our senses), THINKING (How & what we think about our experience), & the OUGHT (The way things "Should" or "Could" BE). Basic conclusion: Western Philosophy started out correct with the pre-Platonic philosophers asking what BEING was & then after Plato the debate became about mind over matter while losing the original meaning & questions about BEING (Reality). A Must Read! 
A11HB3LYLIQNZP B00005UF3L October 29, 2004 7 7 5.0 Luka Returns to Top Form Having listen to Luka Bloom from his first great CD "Riverside" in 1990, I thought he quickly reached to his pinnacle with his 2nd fantastic CD "The Acoustic Motorbike" in 1992. "Turf" in 1994 was good but lacked the creative edge of his pervious genius. Then after a 5 year vacation the lack luster "Salty Heaven" came in 1999, which lost the universal outlook of his previous work. After writing this review I returned to "Salty Heaven" & I am starting to get into it. With "Between the Mountain and the Moon" Luka Bloom returns to almost match "The Acoustic Motorbike" in style containing a quasi Christian/Buddhist spiritual outlook. Luke Bloom sings with great passion about lost loves & hope for the future intermixing personal reflection about Ireland, Christ, the Angel Gabriel, & the Dali Lama. At times Luka Bloom does a clean Irish rap...er...poetry talk that is very unique for those that dislike rap won't mind listening to. At times Luka Bloom can be compared to Bruce Cockburn. Both write & talk/sing about serious subjects in a multi cultural style with excellent guitar work & back up. But un-like the Canadian Bruce Cockburn, Luka Bloom retains more to his Irish/Celtic heritage within a baritone range. Sinead O'Connor joins Luka Bloom in a few songs & makes an amazing match in tone & timber, specially in the song "Love Is a Place I Dream Of". Give it a listen to in the sample section. 
A11HB3LYLIQNZP B0000012U7 February 11, 2004 1 1 4.0 Why do I write these reviews? I am on a Roll today, finding all the odd balls that nobody has reviewed yet. Okay, get this: take the beautiful simplicity of chamber music from the London Sinfonietta; add some Rock-N-Roll rhythms with some wacky modern instrumentation, throw some of the songs off the beat just when you understand the melody, & use some strange titles like 'Yellow Pages', 'Adjustable Wrench', & 'Rust for Piano'...I think that will describe it. Some experts compare his style to the metric complexities of Stravinsky & the repeated formulae of Phillip Glass with the energy Madonna's dance music. Why isn't there a 'Listen to Samples' section? Okay, so you can't hear it for yourself. You will have to take my word on it...Bummer, it maybe out of print...never mind. This is Michael Torke's (born in 1961 & growing up in Milwaukee, Wisc.) earliest & most original work, his later work is more mainstream but still has the some of the features of this very interesting musical experiment. If you find it, grab it. 
A11HB3LYLIQNZP 0767827775 January 27, 2004 2 2 4.0 The Turning Tide When I was a teenager I read a lot of novels & afterwards when I saw a Hollywood movie version of the same books, I was normally disappointed. Why were some of the greatest scenes & dialog missing? The movie "Nicholas & Alexandria" is a "Turning Tide" for many reasons... I saw the movie before reading the book by Robert K. Massie that it was based on, & thought the movie was great. The characters were very real, they where acted by professional Shakespeare & theater actors rather than the standard "Mega Personality" which always gets in the way of historical dramas. The scenes looked "Real" enough, photographed in Spain rather than Russia, but second thought, maybe I don't know what Russia "Should" look like. I was once trapped in the Moscow airport on my way to Kiev Ukraine, but at least I saw some Slavic lands. Returning to the film after a few years I was surprised to figure out that Rasputin was played by Tom Baker, the fourth Dr. Who, who indeed was a Benedict monk in his early 20's. Then I read the book by Robert K. Massie & a few history books... Everything fell a part; the best parts of history were missing or rearranged. Specially Rasputin's death; there was no dancing transvestite at Prince Yusupov's cellar, & Rusputin didn't crawl away from the room, but ran shouting "I will tell the Queen Alexandria on you" with the Prince firing several shots before hitting him. The Prince's friends did not hit Rusputin's body with chains after he was down, but the body was tied with ropes & lowered into an iced river. Believe it or not, Rusputin died from drowning rather than the poison & bullets. The shooting of the Tsar's family had more servants in the firing line & was more gruesome; several people survived the first volley & were chased around with bayonets. Prince Alexis was the last to die with two bullets in the head from a reloaded pistol. Several other bizarre yet important events that would of made great scenes are totally missing from the movie... Yet somehow the movie did "Flow" & if you wanted a historical drama rather than a movie it would last way too long like a Wagner opera. Reading some other reviews, the Tsar's family did speak mostly English, & both Nicholas & Alexandria had English & German relatives. Tsar Nicholas couldn't believe that "Cousin Willie" the German Kaiser, was going to war against him, & Alexandria was a carrier of hemophilia from Queen Victoria's blood line. Therefore to watch an enjoyable yet a historical wash over of the "Turning Tide" of Russia, this DVD will not let you down. Enjoy. 
A11HB3LYLIQNZP 0345438310 January 12, 2004 2 3 4.0 A Novel History Personal Background & Questions: After joining the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church in the mid 1990's & marring a Russian wife in the late 1990's, I needed to read a good informative biography about the last Czar Nicholas Romanov II to find out what historically happen to answer a few questions: Was Moscow the third Rome (a Christian Empire guarding the Christian Orthodox Faith: Rome fell in 410, Constantinople in 1453, & Moscow in 1917)? How did the Russian Empire fall? Is a Christian Theocracy still possible? Is Czar Nicholas II a Saint, was he an untrained prince turned single focus Tsar, or "Bloodly" Nicholas? Who was Rusputin? Was he a hedonistic heretic, a persecuted Staret, or a doubled face sinner/saint? Commentary: After finishing "Nicholas and Alexandra" by Robert K. Massie, most of these questions go unanswered, but at least my options are clarified. The book is very well written for easy reading, almost too well written...in some areas it reads like a novel: over detaining certain information that may not be historical fact. This Novel-ling of history deals mostly with the main characters: what they wear, what facial features or expressions they had. The words that may or may not of been spoken are colored with emotion which adds to the story, but is it history? Lets look at historical biographies this way: First, you have a biography that is a history book. It lists just the facts; this can be rather boring to read. Second, there are books like "Nicholas and Alexandra" that add a little favor to soften the read, or to act out the history. Third, there are books like "I Claudius" by Robert Graves that are fictional autobiographies: fictional writings with historical facts intertwined. Only you the reader know what type of books you may enjoy, or what you really what from a book. If you want to read a good story & get some history, then this may fit your fancy. 
A11HB3LYLIQNZP 0809130939 October 28, 2003 12 12 4.0 The Father of Lenten Prayers St. Ephrem was born at Nisibis during Roman rule, but when the Persians took over the city, he moved & later died in Edessa 373 AD. St. Ephrem wrote numerous works & for easy categorization can be listed in 3 forms: (1) Texts, (2) Exegetical, & (3) Poetical. This book is about the 3rd type, his hymns. The book is beautifully done by Paulist Press in hard back, but this listing is for the paperback edition. One of St. Ephrems Lenten prayers is normally spoken by the entire congregation with prostrations in the Eastern Orthodox Christian church (Eastern Rite) during Lent (40 days before Passion Week & Pascha/Easter). This prayer is included in the book: O Lord and Master of my life, take from me the spirit of sloth, despondency, lust of power, and idle talk; But grant rather the spirit of chastity, humility, patience, and love to thy servant. Yea, O Lord and King, grant me to see my own transgressions, and not to judge my brother; for blessed art Thou unto the ages of ages. Amen. 
A11HB3LYLIQNZP 0571163939 October 10, 2003 4 4 4.0 The Place to Start the Philokalia The Philokalia is a collection of Patristics from Eastern Orthodox Monasticism. Starting from the 2nd to 3rd century to just after the historical break between the Western Roman Catholic & Eastern Orthodox, the many writings were arranged by St Nicodemos of the Holy Mountain (Mt. Athos) & Theophan the Recluse in the 19th century. A few years ago when I was buying this series, there were 4 books with a 5th being published. This book, "Prayer of the Heart" is but an edition from the 4 books about the Jesus Prayer or Prayer of Attention. The prayer came into BEING during the early Egyptian Monastic period of the 3rd or 4th century when the Catholic Church became legal in the Roman Empire, but was in a state of BECOMING until the finished prayer was defended by St. Gregory Palamas in the 14th century. The highlight for me was the writings from St. Symeon the New Theologian, about the 4 methods of prayer (Using Images, Fighting Thoughts, Silence, & Discipline under an Abbot) which helped me remove imagination during prayer. These are not the 4 methods as in bodily prayer, attentive prayer, prayer of the feelings, or spiritual prayer, which are explained by other Church Fathers within this fine book. An introduction or easier book to read about this subject mater is "The Way of the Pilgrim" which is also sold by Amazon.com. 
A11HB3LYLIQNZP B000003ETV May 7, 2003 2 2 4.0 Swedish Singer singing American Jazz With a sweet little girl voice, something like a younger sounding Rickie Lee Jones, Swedish singer Lisa Ekdahl does refreshing interpretations on her 2nd English only Jazz standard CD. She doesn't have the wind or power of an Ella Fitzgerald, but she makes up for it in a different way, with charm. The other major highlight is the back up trio: Peter Nordahl on piano, Ronnie Gardiner on drums, & Patrik Boman on bass. Peter Nordahl at times sounds like a wild Bill Evans, kicking on & off the melodies. He makes a very interesting listen & what I believe is the well welcome stand out. If you like this CD, try the one before: "Back to Earth". 
A11HB3LYLIQNZP B000005IYO April 21, 2003 0 0 4.0 It's Gonna Rain Warning, this is a strange CD. It's not going to fit everyone's taste, but if you are the type that likes to explore, or extremely bored with POP music, then this is the CD for you. This was created & recorded before the computer age, yet deals with the process of the computer age. Back then some Classical Experimenters used tape loops to created multi layered repetitions of rhythm & melody. I believe the high light is "It's Gonna Rain" from a recording of a Pentecosta street preacher yelling about Noah's flood. The words "Its Gonna Rain" become rhythm with something like: "Its Its, Its Gonna Its Gonna, Gonna Gonna, Gonna Rain Gonna Rain, Rain Rain...then the piece adds layers of layers of the sermon until it becomes a vast sound effect. Believe it or not I played "It's Gonna Rain" during a Performance Art piece called "Noah's Art" where I gave out water balloons & pistols to an audience while reading & then acting out the 10 commandants. The Tape loop was used to drive everyone into a frenzy to drown me with water. It Worked. Thanks Steve. 
A11HEM5O345OL3 0763609978 September 7, 2000 9 9 5.0 Absolutely Gorgeous As a longtime lover of Fairy tales, I've gotten rather picky about which picture book versions I pick up. And I wanted to buy this book the first time I flicked through it. This one includes a variety of stories, all well known, from the obvious choices, like Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast, to Aladdin, and the Wild Swans. The stories are told well, though without any newness - these are familiar, comfortable stories. Ah, but it wasn't the tellings of the stories which had me sold on this book. Jane Ray's illustrations are utterly beautiful. Normally, I am a fan of neo-renaissance illustrations - almost realistic, almost three dimensional, and full of elegant landscapes (See Kinuko Craft's work) The illustrations in this book are flat, far more stylized - but they're full of movement and feeling, and they look like they came from the best of medieval manuscripts. The touches of metallic gold only add to this impression. The full colour full page illustrations are also complemented by silhouette illustrations and border images along many other pages. This is inspired art, lovely to look on, and perfectly matches the feeling of fairy tale stories. 
A11HG876A03OBN 0553212559 August 17, 2001 0 4 3.0 Short, sweet, but not so to the point I believe that this book could be classified as one of those stories that you are glad you took the time to read after you finish it, but getting to that final stage of completion is more of a task than it may seem. Surprisingly, this is one of the few short stories (90 some pages) that I have ever read, that seemed to droan on for a good half of the time. Never the less, there were some profound moments in the story in which I felt I had been given some truly great moments in literature. My only qualm was that it needed to be about half (or cut it down by a fair 20 pgs) so the reader would not loose so much interest. Do remember though, it is only 90 pages long, so it is not one of the more monotonous scripts out there. 
A11HNFCOB4AC2T 1582346054 February 8, 2006 4 5 2.0 Darwin's barnacles as New Age crystals? I have spent many afternoons exploring tidepools and mudflats, so I looked forward to reading this book. What a disappointment. Sure the descriptions of marine curiosities are pleasing but they cannot bear the weight of the author's efforts at symbolism. It is a book that is built on some of the more beautiful aspects of science but really wants to be a New Age magical realism kind of thing. It does not "go." The dissonance is way too irritating. Like combining Darwin with mysticism. It hurts to read. And by the way, I'm astounded that the author does not credit all that barnacle info at least indirectly to Darwin who still rules as the greatest barnacle expert and especially in the area of sexual selection in barnacles. Which brings me to the book's other obsession. The sex lives of 13 year old boys are already embarrassing. But come on! Would that the writer had put the same care into writing about this topic as he does about polykete worms. It's boring, cliche, and sexist to boot. Yuck. The occasional misogynistic threads are irritating enough to want to toss it. And I am a forgiving reader who makes a point of reading debut fiction and buying it even in hardback. Way too many smudges of sky and repetitive imagery. The side characters are underdeveloped. The center does not hold. Not recommended. If you like bio-fiction, read Andrea Barrett instead. 
A11HNFCOB4AC2T 0060263954 January 10, 2000 11 12 5.0 Deeper and Richer than the Movie--a gem I read this to my 5 year old for the first time at age 40--and I found it astounding. The 1st half of the book is full of charm, humour, cleverness--but then it becomes much more sophisticated. Stuart becomes a seeker and while his adventures along the way are interesting and extremely entertaining, they are also tinged with a sense of loss. Stuart has dreams that cannot be fulfilled. His quest for perfection prevents him from enjoing the present. He becomes prideful and, while funny, it keeps him from certain wonders. The ending is incredibly beautiful but does not resolve the plot and is quite sophisticated compared to many kids books. ADVICE: As you read, look for the discrepancies between the desired and dreamed for and the actual. This is what gives this slim and beautiful book its pulse -- it's also a great way to talk about the book with kids. Think Don Quixote. Skip the flick! This is much more valuable! 
A11HV501OX9MNV B00061X95Q December 25, 2004 6 9 4.0 Nice CD... I was very hesitant to buy this CD...seeing as it was new and all, I wasn't sure I would like it because I thought that Elton would try a more "modern" approach...in fact, I was so hesitant, that I didn't even buy it--I received it as a gift. Thankfully, I was wrong about Elton trying a "modern" approach. It was so nice to hear the nice Elton that I was accustomed to. It's definitely not his best CD, but I still enjoyed it. I find that the more times I listen to it, the more I like it. Weight of the World--9/10 Porch Swing in Tupelo--9/10 Answer in the Sky--9/10 Turn the Lights Out When You Leave--10/10 My Elusive Drug--8/10 They Call Her the Cat--9/10 Freaks in Love--9/10 All That I'm Allowed--10/10 I Stop and I Breathe--10/10 Too Many Tears--10/10 It's Getting Dark in Here--9/10 I Can't Keep This from You--10/10 All in all, it's a nice CD. Nothing that blew me away, there weren't even any songs that really just stood out to me...but, I would recommend the CD. Especially to the more familiar Elton John fans--it's just nice to hear him on new CDs. 
A11I0KEN069MP4 0439784549 July 17, 2005 4 12 4.0 Great but slightly disappointing I read this book in one day, and I had spent the week before reading parts of Book 5, where I beleived some crucial clues to Book Six were. The first five books seemed to me to progress in some kind of coherent pattern, as if the author had the whole set written in her head up to that point. This book however, seems as if it was almost written by someone else. Almost all of the questions that came up in book 5 were either not answered or rendered moot by this completely new path the series has taken. I enjoyed the book but I have to say that the ending was a disappointment to me and I do not see how every lose end can be tied up in one final book. 
A11I1I9QLMAM1A B0006BKH3S November 9, 2005 11 12 5.0 Reading some of these reviews made me think I'd never be able to listen to my IPOD in my car When you read the reviews for the various FM transmitters and the tape deck converters, you start to think that there is no way to successfully link your IPOD to a car that doesn't have a dock or a Aux plug in. After reading the reviews I was sure that I was embarking on some sort of a Saga to find the system that would work in my city. I went to a retail store, where the salesman vehimently recommended the Monster Cable product listed here. They didn't have any in stock at that store, and I didn't have time to drive accross town to their other location which had seven in stock. So I went home and saw that it was $20 cheaper on Amazon, so I ordered it. I was learing about buying it mail order, because I was convinced by the reviewers that it wasn't going to work and I was going to have to return it. (however you do that with Amazon, I don't know) Anyway, if you read nothing else, read this line: I plugged it in in my car, hooked in the IPOD, picked a random station using the instructions that are attached to the cord (very good place for instructions) and there it was. Crystal clear success on my first attempt. I drove about 30 minutes to the post office and back and never heard a lick of static nor did my signal fade a single time. At least in Colorado Springs, CO, this product is flawless. 
A11I1I9QLMAM1A B00000J3Q2 September 2, 2002 0 0 3.0 someone using this case for the M500 When I bought this case I had a Palm V, and it fit great and seemed to be very capable of doing its job. Unfortunately I quickly decided to return the Palm V and get a M500 instead. Not wanting to return the case, I decided to use it with the M500. Though I don't have any problems because of this, I wouldn't recommend it because the fit is not very good. The Palm V fits in this case snuggly and securely, as it was designed for it. While using it with the slightly thinner and smaller M500 seems to offer the same level of protection it has too much freedom to move around. Another reason why I would recommend finding a differant case for the M500 is because wearing the case on the belt is a little bulky. A slightly smaller case designed for the M500 would be a little less combersome on your belt. If you need a case for a Palm V, this one is well made, offers protection for the screen on both sides, via hard plates, and seems to handle the everyday rigers of an outdoor job very well.

A11IDX2W2GVVS2 0679777547 April 15, 2004 5 6 4.0 A Refreshing and Entertaining Read I read this book many years after seeing the movie "The 9th Gate" several times. I had always been intrigued by the movie and finally managed to read the book. It should be noted that the movie didn't follow the book all that closely. The Club Dumas is much more intriguing and complex. If you liked the movie, you must absolutely read the book, as the characters are much more interesting. Perez-Reverte's writing style is astoundingly refreshing. As an avid reader of both fiction and non-fiction, I have to admit that I have not encountered such a rich writing style before. Reverte's attention to detail is stunning and astonishing without being dull. It hearkens back to the old 'dark detective' style of writing while remaining invigorating throughout. I am now hooked and will begin reading some of Reverte's other works. 
A11IRYY09HKIY0 B0000E5SJB January 13, 2005 4 12 5.0 Divine Inspiration... First there was the birth of religious belief in the savannahs of Africa as our ancestors encountered entheogenic plants and fungi. Flash forward many thousands of years to ancient India, where the Mahabharata was authored, then to the Middle East, where the texts of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible originated. Then the Qur'an. Then the works of Baha'ullah. They are all antecedents to this amazing recording, truly inspired by God (or, by John McLaughlin's limited conception of "God" based upon Theosophical and Yogic belief systems). Rockin' pundits of the 1960s may have said that "Clapton is God," but John McLaughlin is among the rare musicians who come close to realizing that lofty, worshipful statement. No one truly compares to John McLaughlin. We're not worthy! We're not worthy! 
A11IRYY09HKIY0 B0001LN44C May 17, 2004 4 4 1.0 Homeopathy and Ayahuasca DO NOT MIX!!! Ayahuasca is properly known as a powerful hallucinogenic/purgative tea originally from the jungles of South America. It is NOT meant to be a homeopathic remedy, and the idea is ridiculously stupid. It needs to be highly *CONCENTRATED* (not diluted) to be effective from any standpoint, whether it be for psychoactivity, or somatic/healing effects. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, AS YOU WILL NOT BE BUYING REAL AYAHUASCA. Ayahuasca typically contains DMT and a MAOI to prevent DMT's destruction before it crosses the blood/brain barrier. If this was actually ayahuasca (although the "ayahuasca plant" Banisteriopsis caapi is sometimes available here), it would most certainly not be sold on Amazon because it would be a controlled substance, subject to Federal drug laws. Shame on this company - and any other "alternative healing" folks - for exploiting the populace's ignorance.

I listen to this CD whenever I need spine-tingling artistic inspiration. My very favorite selection is #8, Sirt im Sasani, or "My Heart is Trembling." Prepare for a full kundalini awakening of the musical variety. Highly recommended. Buy it today. The other CDs in this series are top-notch too, but nothing compares to this one. Spread the word... 
A11IRYY09HKIY0 0892818514 December 11, 2001 4 4 5.0 Do You Like Flaming Transparent People Staring At You? Yes, the title of my review is a little tongue in cheek, but only because I love Grey's work so much, and I'm soooooo jealous of his technique. I first saw Grey's work in a mall bookstore the year I graduated from high school, 1993, and as youngster artist, the paintings I saw were everything I aspired to be (with a dash of Keith Haring thrown in). Darn it, if this guy didn't take all my ideas before I even had them! At least he doesn't paint spheres like I do. Anyway, my parents bought me "Sacred Mirrors" as a graduation present, and that book is rewarding each and every time I turn to it for pleasure or inspiration. "Transfigurations" is an all around better book many times over. Everything that was Greyish about the work in "SM" can be found in plentiful supply, but his work has certainly taken on more depth since then. I was never really one for paintings like "Gaia" or "Universal Mind Lattice." I'm not sure if it's because he's been meditating a lot, reading more Terence McKenna or drinking cauldron upon cauldron of ayahuasca, or if he simply became "one" with certain patterns and uses of primary colors, but the hallucinogenic ("psychedelic," or better yet, "entheogenic") tendencies of his art have exploded. The male/female Homo erectuses (is that the plural, or is it "erecti?") with magic mushrooms and Cannibas all around are perhaps an obvious example, but virtually everything here is laden with a psychedelic aura. I especially like the small drawing based on an ayahuasca vision (please see the crude but brilliant book of ayahuasquero Pablo Amaringo's art, "Ayahuasca Visions" if that work intrigues you), being a fan of the brew. I've always admired Grey for his willingness to admit that such substances play a prominent role in his life, though I have to say that I would have had little doubt otherwise even if he kept it a secret from us. Before I saw this book, I had the distinct pleasure of seeing "Cosmic Christ" in person at Baltimore's American Visionary Art Museum (you need to see this place if you haven't already), and I must have stared at the work for at least a half hour. It's really a masterpiece. I can't wait to see how Grey's work develops in the next few decades, assuming neither he nor I are murdered or drastically crippled by another al-Queda attack. The book is, in a word, amazing. You need to buy it now! As one of the reviewers succinctly put it, "we've already missed out on Rumi, Blake, Swedenborg, and Gibran, but we've been sent a comforter for our time flowering from the same vine," and I couldn't agree more with that estimation, but for the fact that it didn't mention Neil Finn (especially Crowded House's swan song, "Together Alone").

A11J17A2HNP5FQ B000063166 August 1, 2003 1 3 5.0 As Jazzy as the Movie... I love Jazz, and this CD brings the best out of Jazz music. I loved the movie too (not *so* common places), but this CD is even better than the movie. (I know that's not the real sountrack, but that's an excellent disk anyway.) It's hard to find such a nice collections of Good Melodies alltogether and, moreover, in such good arrangements. At first when I noticed that, for example, Gee Baby, Ain't Good To You was not by Ella Fritgerald and Louis Armstrong (until now, the only ones who can play it that good) but by Matt Rollings with Lyle Lovett's version, I was a little dissapointed, but then, after hearing it in full, I noticed how wrong I was, this one has nothing to envy to the other (well, yes, Ella & Louis ;-), and so, with all the songs. So, if you like it, like me, the Jazzy way (I mean, being cozy in a cozy livingroom -near the fireplace- reading something nice in some winter afternoon) well this album will provide the right coziness for that moment... (it's also goog enough when you are dinning with your girl at home and you want something more intimate after dinner, but that's another story ;-) 
A11J17A2HNP5FQ 392907835X January 7, 2001 1 5 3.0 Nice book but... I liked ALL Richard Kern books, and since, people liking Kern recommend me this one, I decied to take a look. To my sourprise, this book is not that bad (I put 4 * to it) but, it's not comparable (IMHO) to Richard Kern Works. It hasn't that "je-ne-se-qui" that all Kern books have. I don't know how to explain it better, but, perhaps, you'll like this album, but in my case, comming from Kern, I found it a little "poor"... 
A11J17A2HNP5FQ 0745624502 March 28, 2000 2 8 3.0 Something to be read if you're interested in sociology If you know a little about general stuff, you'll know who's Giddens. He's not a newbie on the sociology scene. Moreover, he's one of Tony Blair's advisors (consultants). I think this book takes the Third way in a serious way, and that it's the Third Way in itself. Read it if you are interested in the subject, if not, do it anyway, you'll be interested after reading... 
A11J6S7N0LIPOY 6302932831 July 14, 2000 4 4 5.0 A "Must" video for T'ai-chi practitioners This is an amazing video about Push Hands - the two person T'ai-chi exercise which teaches you the basics of feeling and using internal energy - both for self defense and for healing. The tape divides the subject of Push Hands into many chapters, detailing each nuance, each technique, each principle and showing examples in free style push hands. It shows that push hands is not just pushing and shoving but is a fine art which helps you to become aware of yourself and your connection to other people. Mr. Klein, the teacher, explains the principles so anyone can understand them and you can easily see, from the push hands being done, how those principles apply. This video is a great contribution to T'ai-chi training. 
A11J6S7N0LIPOY 6302533295 May 26, 2000 1 1 5.0 I'm Happy With This This tape is clear and well taught. This is the first time I've tried using pressure points in my sparring. My sparring partner and I use the tape and it has added a new dimension to our sparring. Can't say I'm good at it yet, though. I think that you need to know this stuff if you practice the martial arts. It gives you a great advantage. This tape is easy to follow and practice with. 
A11JB8KWAHAY09 0312202938 March 8, 2000 3 3 4.0 True grit After all the readable but increasingly outlandish thrillers by Patricia Cornwell, P.D. James, Nelson DeMille et al that I've read and enjoyed over recent years, it's a pleasant surprise to come across a writer as gritty as Rankin (a bit like a Scottish James Ellroy). His dialogue leaps off the page and rings in your ears, while the labyrinthine plotting keeps you reading well after bed-time. A great deal of the force of this novel comes from the fact that Rebus is a "human" character with his failings and foibles. I'm definitely going to read more of Rankin's stuff. 
A11JB8KWAHAY09 0140282033 February 3, 2000 8 8 3.0 Pleasant but... I don't really know what to think of this book. True, it is a sensuous experience at times with its wonderful descriptions of the chocolate-making process. However, having lived in a small French village for six years now, I find the description of village life a little too twee and "touristy". A real village priest would never have the power that the one in the book has (at the start of the novel anyway). And the village itself is a little too idealised. Most of the people in my village would never be able to afford Vianne's chocolates. There again, the back-stabbing atmosphere of a small French village is spot-on. Read it but don't expect to find Lansquenet on your next trip to France. 
A11JCUFULFLOYX 1555603041 December 6, 1999 6 6 3.0 More Gear -- Good! / More Rules -- Bad! The danger of expansion-type supplements to any RPG system is the tendancy to over-burden the system with too many new rules; rules that slow down play and can mire a session in number-crunching and extra dice-rolling. Unfortunately, the RBB2 does exactly that... Don't get me wrong, the book is packed with some really good ideas and long-needed rules clarifications from RBB1, but in some areas the development team clearly missed the mark (for anyone who has already purchased the book, the new "flux ratings" in Sensors/ECM/ECCM rules are a prime example of this). Also, the modifications to the vehicle armor and body rules have really changed rigger combat, and I don't believe in a good way; we had two experienced riggers get their banshees turned into scrap-metal by one missile shot -- hardly a result conducive to enjoyable gameplay. The new drones and vehicles are nice, and the vehicle creation rules are a long-overdue addition (though again, seemingly a bit over-complex). My advice: get it for the new gear, ignore the majority of the rules, and run off of rigger combat info from the SR3 hardcover... 
A11JZYOPFMDGXW B000060PCC March 8, 2002 2 6 3.0 Nice songs, not especially Christian When JOC debuted I was totally hooked on their songs, playing them over and over again. I felt a spiritual awakening as this Christian music wasn't like the old boring stuff of yesteryear but had an alternative edge and great message. Much Afraid was less of a delight for me, and I found it somewhat depressing. Some great tunes shone through, like "Weighed Down." If I Left the Zoo was a disaster, and like the reviewer below, I vowed I could never enjoy JOC again. This was a sad day for me as I'd hailed JOC as the greatest Christian band of its time. I even saw them in concert during their "Bubblemaker" tour in 1997 and they were very cool to see. So it was with great hesitence that I gave this CD a listen. I admit I have a very critical ear toward JOC now. The songs were good, but nothing amazing. I didn't get chills from any of the tunes or find any enlightenment in the lyrics. The music is simply good -- not bad, not great. All in all, disappointing, but mostly disappointing because the lyrics could be about anything or anyone. There is no Gospel message here. While listening to this CD I got the distinct impression that JOC was courting mainstream radio and seeking mainstream hits and acceptance. Whether or not it's true, it was my impression. Their lyrics used to be far more powerful, insightful. They made you think, and they had basis in Scripture. I don't need for a band to mention Jesus every three seconds, but JOC seems to have gone too far off to the other side, a more neutral, non offesnive, yet also non interesting realm. It's fine for a nice rock album, but I need more meat with my potatoes. 
A11K7IFISH954S B000AP2YZE December 5, 2005 2 2 5.0 Elbow hits its stride Elbow's 3rd release sees them taking a giant leap forward. As I said in my review of "Asleep in the Back", you could sense that these guys had the potential to achieve great things, and after an impressive follow-up, they finally have put together their first masterpiece. "Asleep" only hinted at this potential with a couple of brilliant stand-out songs, but the rest of the album was nothing more than mediocre and at times downright boring. "Cast of Thousands" was much more consistent from start to finish, but really had only one 5 star song in the incredible "Fugitive Motel". But on "Leaders of the Free World", they have taken all the good points of the first two albums, combined them, and taken them a step further. "Leaders" is a bit less spacey than their first two releases, but their approach remains the same, constructing their beautiful melodies in an orchestra fashion. Layers of instruments all complement each other perfectly, and guarantee that each listen will reveal more detail than the last. They rock out a bit more than in the past, especially on "Forget Myself", the title track, and "Mexican Standoff", but there are still plenty off the slow moody sounds that Guy Garvey's voice is perfectly suited for. Garvey's lyrics are better than ever, both when waxing political as he does on the title track("passing the gun from father to feckless son, we're caught in a landslide where only the good die young"), and when sadly singing about a lost love in songs like "My Very Best" and "Great Expectations" (the latter of which is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have heard in years). Fans of Elbow's previous work will certainly enjoy this album, but the appeal of "Leaders" is sure to be more widespread than its little-known predecesors. Even more exciting is the fact that there could be greater things to come from a band that seems to have finally put all the pieces together. One of the best albums of 2005. 
A11K7IFISH954S B00003CXCI September 6, 2002 0 0 5.0 A Classic The hardest thing about writing a review for this movie is figuring out where to start. Say Anything...is one of my favorite movies, and one of the best overall films ever made. Here we see John Cusack starring in another story that is entertaining on so many levels. At times, Say Anything is funny, sad, serious, realistic, and bittersweet. Cameron Crowe did an excellent job making the main characters believeable and interesting, making it very easy to get caught up in their emotions. This movie brings tears to my eyes every time I see it as it is extremely easy to relate to Cusack's character, especially if you have ever gone through anything similar to the events that transpire between Lloyd and Diane. Everyone always talks about the famous scene involving the Boom Box, but to me the most memorable part of this movie can be narrowed down to one line: "She Gave me a pen. I Gave her my heart and she gave me a pen". I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone, if you can't relate to it right now, you will someday. 
A11K7IFISH954S B0000029HS April 24, 2002 0 0 4.0 Excellent Debut Sponge has been one of my favorite bands for a long time, and this was the disc that started it all. First of all I think it is pretty safe to assume that just about everyone who listened to the radio during the "alternative" era has heard "Plowed" before. Its one of those songs that not too many people know by name, but if they heard it randomly somewhere they would say "hey, I remember this song, this song rocks!" It was all over the radio around 1995 and even is featured during the movie "Empire Records" (although sadly was left off the soundtrack). I guess my point is, if you paid any attention to music in the mid-90's, you know "Plowed". The thing is, the rest of Rotting Pinata is just as good. Sponge never got any recognition because they never stood out, they didn't have anything that set them apart from the literally hundreds of alternative bands that were crowding the airwaves at the time. They are just a great post-punk rock band with incredible songwriting. Although Sponge definitely got better with their later albums, Pinata is a great collection of songs ranging from upbeat punky tunes like the title track, "Plowed", and Miles to slower, quieter songs like "Giants", "Drownin", and "Fields". There isn't a bad song on the album, and thats including the awesome secret tune at the end. If you want to get into Sponge, I would start with thier latest album "New Pop Sunday", but this should be next on your list. 
A11K7IFISH954S B000002JDL February 11, 2002 1 1 5.0 Virtually perefect from start to finish Although I had liked "The Bazaar" when it first came out in 1995, but for some reason I decided not to buy "The Edges of Twilight". When "Temptation" came out 2 years later, I made sure I didn't make the same mistake twice and bought it immediately. And as bad as it may sound, I count the purchasing of this album to be a major event in my life. "Transmission" is what started my obsession with The Tea Party. This album has everything a music fan could ask for; Great songwriting, intelligent and emotional lyrics, stellar production, and a wide variety of sounds, a little bit for everybody. First of all, "Psychopomp" alone is worth the price of this album. In my opinion it is the most emotional song ever written, period. The rest of the songs are just as good though, with the loud driving drums of "Temptation", "Army Ants", and "Gyroscope" perfectly mixing with the sombre melodies of "Alarum", "Release", "Aftermath", and "Emerald". The title track shows all the eastern influences the band is so well known for, while "Babylon" is borderline techno. If you haven't heard much by the Tea Party, this is the best place to start. 
A11KSATJ36J4IA B00009OOH9 June 26, 2003 1 1 2.0 So disappointing I've been a Phair fan since Exile in Guyville and I have to admit that I couldn't have been more disappointed with this latest album. I know a lot of people disliked whitechocolatespaceegg but I thought it was okay and could lead to new directions for Phair. If I had known it would have led to Avril Lavigne (which is unfair to Phair, the lyrics are more complex than anything sk8ter queen Lavigne could imagine) I would have slammed it more. The best way to describe this new album as is the female equivalent of having a midlife crisis and buying a sports car or getting hair replacement surgery. It's ugly and sad in men and it's ugly and sad in women. The song "Rock Me" was okay though. 
A11KSATJ36J4IA 0595148573 February 16, 2001 7 7 4.0 A burden of proof met The mantra in science circles is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Chuck Morse's claim is that he is the most controversial commentator in America, an extraordinary one given people like G. Gordon Liddy, Oliver North, Don Imus and even Rush Limbaugh could claim that crown. Morse will be familiar to readers of Enter Stage Right as a senior writer and regular contributor. Based out of very liberal Boston and a self-described "politically conservative Jew," he also holds court every weeknight with a nationally syndicated talk show on the American Freedom Network. To his credit, Morse marshals some strong evidence for his claim in a book of his collected work, "Thunder Out of Boston: Collected Columns of Chuck Morse," many of which have appeared in this magazine and others on the World Wide Web. Touching on subjects as wide-ranging as the Second Amendment to world government, why Bill Clinton shouldn't have been impeached - you read that right - to why Jesus Christ wasn't a communist, Morse pulls absolutely no punches. With a ruthless efficiency, Morse systematically takes on the sacred cows and deeds of liberalism one by one. On the impeachment: while the "web of deceit and swirling around Clinton will forever remain a loathsome and despicable debacle," Morse states that the "impeachment has stained and cheapened the letter and spirit of impeachment in the Constitution. The charges did not include treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors." Rather, he writes, presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon Johnson should have been hauled before Congress for actions they undertook. Morse also trains his considerable guns on American policies both past and present, blasting in equal measure radical elements in the militia movement, the jihad against National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston, the cultural denigration The Beatles were responsible for, the role America played in installing Fidel Castro ("Fidel - Our Man in Havana" as Morse refers to him), and sex education, among others. There are few hot buttons that Morse fails to bash in the fifty essays that comprise the collection. While some of the issues presented in Thunder Out of Boston are no longer front-page items, Morse's take on them are interesting enough to warrant a second look. If Morse has a failing it's that he sometimes comes across repetitive in both tone and words - leaving him open to the charge that he takes shortcuts instead of carefully building up his case. Repeatedly referring to your ideological enemies as communists may play well with John Birchers, but Morse a better writer than that and should avoid what could be construed as name-calling. Thunder Out of Boston also could have used some more editing with several essays suffering from typos. As a case for Morse's claim, Thunder Out of Boston is difficult to ignore. Some conservative commentators have been moving towards the center in recent years, perhaps in a bid to prove they can extend their popularity beyond the stereotypical angry white male, and becoming less interesting in the process. It would be difficult to accuse Morse of a similar charge, either in print or on the air. Given how prolific he's been recently, don't be surprised to see a second edition that will prove becoming soft is a sin that Morse won't commit any time soon. 
A11KTYTE2T1MX8 0811811565 October 5, 2004 0 2 5.0 THE pregnancy book It doesnt matter if you are the mother or father to be, this is the book that can guide you and help you find the answers you are looking for. On top of being a wealth of information, it is fun and has a lot of encouraging little hints and tips. If you have this book, you dont need the others that are around. 
A11KTYTE2T1MX8 0385508042 April 15, 2003 1 2 3.0 Good Read This is a standard Grisham book, where the reader gets some insight into what (according to Grisham) drives lawyers and how the rich and famous lives, interesting characters, and greedy villains (not just lawyers). There are as such no surprises, but if you like Grisham, this will definately not disappoint you. 
A11L5M4MJP00UW B000001EBI April 22, 2006 0 0 5.0 Can't Stop Listening First off, this album gives you over 53 minutes of music and 13 songs, which is a bonus over many albums that are only 10 songs, which can run as little as 30 minutes. This is spicy, spunky music that just sucks you in. Some of the topics are a little racy and naughty, but is done mostly in a tasteful way (no nasty words or cuss words). It is hard to describe this album, because it is not quite like the album titled Buster Poindexter. That's a great album too and some people consider Buster a one hit wonder with Hot, Hot, Hot that appears on that album. That was probably his biggest hit and there are no big hits on this album. Nothing stands out in particular, although several of the songs are very catchy. In spite of that, every song is enjoyable and energetic. I think that's what makes this album so much fun; it is full of energy; you can hear it and feel it. It sounds like Buster puts his whole being into feeling the music and sounds like he is partying hard! The only thing I don't like about this album is that there is a bit too much repeating in a couple of songs (especially Inez). Be warned that this doesn't really sound like "Spanish" music; some of the songs have Spanish words and some have Spanish topics. It sounds more Cuban in some ways (like Ricky Ricardo's music). There is somewhat of a latin beat to some of the songs. It definately is like a rocketship ride, with a lot of excitement and speed. Not for everyone, but if you like something spunky, funky and with a good dance beat, this is it! Too bad this isn't currently available on Amazon, as it is well worth a listen. Includes a 16 page color booklet with all the lyrics too. Great accompanying band and backup singers too. Good crisp, quality sound too; not muddy like some modern albums. 
A11L5M4MJP00UW B000002NAK November 11, 2005 1 5 5.0 Best Movie Soundtrack Ever I hate to say good things about an album that Madonna might make some money from, because I think she is a filthy slut who has used any gimmick she can to make money regardless of the morals. That being said, I think her singing in this movie is a cut above her popular albums and is highly entertaining. I saw the movie and enjoyed the music so much that I had to have the album; it's a 2-cd album and I paid more for it than most any other album I have purchased in a long time. Keep in mind there are a lot of songs on the album that don't have Madonna singing. The singers may not be the best, but the music is so entertaining that it makes no difference. The movie had so much dialog mixed with the music that this album could have been a disaster, but they did an excellent job of getting the flavor of the movie and using appropriate amounts of dialog with music. I think this is one of the best movie soundtracks ever done. Great editing job and all the songs from the movie seem to be here. If any were missing, I didn't notice. Not disappointing in any way. Worth hearing over and over again. 
A11L5M4MJP00UW B0002F7I9Y January 30, 2005 6 6 4.0 Worth Having For the Historical Value Alone Right up front let me say that I have never been a big Ray Charles fan. There is something about his style of singing that I just don't care for. In spite of that, the man had a huge influence on the music world and was a tremendous performer. This album is a little odd because of the assortment of people with such varied styles, as well as a somewhat strange choice of songs. The interesting thing is that in most cases it succeeds. In reading the other reviews, it was apparent that not everyone always agreed on which duets were the best. That indicates to me that it depends a lot on your own preferences which songs you'll like. There is something here for everyone. Ray does sound a little weak and shaky at times, but at his worst he still sounds better than some so-called artists at their best. I think this is worth having just because it is his last album and due to the uniqueness. I think that any last effort by Ray Charles would have been disappointing. After all, when a legend has done it all, it's not easy to top yourself. Given that Ray was soon to die and knew it, there is still a lot of "juice" left that comes across here. Most of us are willing to cut him some slack. No, this is not the spunky Ray Charles of earlier years, but I don't think anyone should or would expect that. 
A11L5M4MJP00UW B0000064FA July 25, 2004 9 10 5.0 An Essential for Your Complete Collection Just for the historical significance alone, this album is worth owning. The title song was extremely popular and sold over 9 million singles and albums. It is still very listenable, even though the war it was about was over also 30 years ago. As far as the quality of the music, the Amazon review describes Sadler's voice as thin, stilted baritone. I don't know what that means exactly, as I find his voice clear and smooth and very easy to listen to. He ennunciates very well and you don't have to read the lyrics to know what he is singing. Okay, he is not the greatest singer who ever lived, but who cares? He can sing and does a more than passable job of it. Those who are anti-war may not like this album much, but mainly it's about a soldier's experiences in the war and isn't really political in nature--at least most of the songs aren't. Very listenable and enjoyable whether you are a dove or a hawk. The A team song is a nice bonus track. Great sound quality. Well worth owning. 
A11L90R7RWJA8H B00009B1RV June 19, 2004 6 6 5.0 Equally enjoyable for me too! I'm thrilled when our two year old goes to the DVD cabinet, pulls this out and says, "I want Star!" Of all the DVDs in our library for our two year old, I prefer this one head and shoulders above the rest. In fact, I enjoy it myself. Unlike other childrens' DVDs, this is wonderful even if it's just playing in the background while the children play with blocks in the next room. The classical soundtrack is refreshing first thing in the morning. And the artwork! I'm glad that my child is being introduced to the beauty of Van Gogh and Picasso at a young age. It's very well done and the artworks chosen are appropriate and enjoyable for children, even including one from "Goodnight Moon", one of her favorite bedtime books. The only flaw might be that this is thirty minutes long. My two year old doesn't object to that, but when this DVD is over I find myself playing it again. I wish there was a 60 or 90 minute version for grown ups! 
A11L90R7RWJA8H B000002V0N December 11, 1999 9 9 5.0 June's favorite, for good reason Two other reviews on this page already express how good this set is. Only thing I could really add is that "Round Midnight" is quite possibly the most stunning moment in June's entire catalog. I loved the "Something Cool" CD but tended to be naturally skeptical that the rest of someone's catalog could measure up to that classic. "The Misty Miss Christy" closed the deal for me, making me a dedicated June Christy fan. Although I'm also especially fond of "Dearly Beloved", "A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening", "Sing Something Simple" and of course, "For All We Know" (no, not the Carpenters song) every song is, well - it doesn't get any better than this. 
A11LG21L88WB9L 0739308807 August 21, 2005 5 9 1.0 Could not get through the Audio Version Maybe it's not such a good idea to have the author read her own book aloud. Ms. Reichl is a much more talented writer than reader. I found her delivery so nasal and monotone and gasp--Boring! that I didn't even finish the first disk. Now I shall go in search of the book to read myself as it does promise to be interesting. Just not read aloud by the author please. 
A11LG21L88WB9L 0345453417 October 23, 2004 2 2 5.0 Don't Miss This One One of the most powerful books I've read in a long time. We had a rash of these kinds of stories in the news at one time but the couragous and selfless resolution Howard gave her story impressed me like no other. So well written, and such powerfully compelling characters. I want to have Milla and Diaz over for dinner and get to know them even better. And hot? Oh my yes! Howard is gifted in writing emotionally gripping love scenes. Thanks for such a wonderful read, Ms. Howard. 
A11LG21L88WB9L 039915180X July 21, 2004 3 4 2.0 Is Sandford bored with Lucas? I'm terrified it may be so because his latest offering is well written but oh so boring. Sandford's an excellent writer so that aspect of his story telling is never in question but Lucas is phoning it in on this one. Will he listen to Weather and start building Big New Houses? I sure hope not. Nor do I really want Sandford to get rid of Lucas' new family happiness so he can have "edge" again. (However, wouldn't some rolling around in the sheets between Lucas and the horny Russian have been lovely? Lucas could have made her so happy if he was still single, dangit.) I don't think I could like him if he was out cheating on his new wife and baby son, but something has to be done. Lucas is way too young to be put out to pasture. Here's hoping that Mr. Sandford can regain enthusiasm in him and for him. The Porsche driving Davenport is one of the Greats. Too many TV shows have died off after the main character gets married. Hoping this isn't Davenport's fate. Who really likes Weather anyway? By the way, the best scenes in the whole book are Weather driving through the garage door and the cat fight in the restaurant. Hilarious. 
A11LHCWQ7F8KNU 0696211521 April 5, 2002 4 6 5.0 Can't put it down I've spent a lot of time looking at all the new decorating books for spring. I buy several decorating books every year and love, love, love them. But I am picky. I love this book which I came across by accident at the bookstore. This is not exactly a decorating book, although I plan to use it as such. It's big and gloriously crammed with color photos of "getaway" homes. The book tells how to go about finding a second home or weekend home but it also writes about decorating and remodeling and so on. Those ideas work for any home. I like nautical style, so I found a lot of that in this book. It shows variations on cabin and seashore styles in both home types and interior decorating. It's great to flip through this book, and I have trouble putting it down. That's what got me interested in it at the bookstore. I finally had to buy it because I kept finding pictures of one room after another that had ideas I wanted to use in our home. Just great. Glorious to look at and helpful also. 
A11LJXD2GQ4JF0 0553108204 April 5, 2000 10 11 5.0 A Very Interesting Book I unlike some others rather enjoyed this book. I thought that the first person perspective was handled very well. I also thought that it was a good idea to present the Jedi Academy series from a different point of view. The story itself is very good and Stackpole once again shows he is a master at conveying the feel of a fight through writing. This is one of his best novels and I was gripped the whole way through, so gripped I finished it in two days! If there is one thing I don't like about this book it is the fact it was released in hardcover a year before it was released in paperback. I know it isn't the first book to do this but it is kind of annoying seing it in a book store in hardcover and knowing you can't buy it because it costs too much. All in all this is a very good book and I would suggest it for fans of Star Wars and non-fans alike. 
A11LS12ZU93SV6 B00002ST1O February 21, 2006 0 0 4.0 Is that a mermaid in your pocket or are you just happy to see me? This is really just the NES version with only four colors (four shades of either green or grey if you're playing it on the original GB or GB Pocket). You trap enemies in bubbles then throw them at walls, other enemies, or nothing at all. You can enhance the distance and the effect of your bubbles with power-ups. There's really nothing more to this title. It's easy and fun, but once you beat it, there's really nothing left to do except play it again. You could look for hidden forks, pipes, and other stuff from Ariel's grotto, but what fun is that? 
A11LS12ZU93SV6 0553291017 May 7, 2002 1 1 4.0 a great story if you can stay on track Not to be confused with the film, "House on Haunted Hill", The House on the Hill is about a blind convict, living in a formerly condemned house, who's crime involved raping young girls. The tale is told non-narritvely through three characters: a cop, a mother, and her daughter. If you're looking for a scary book, this is it. The situations of the kidnapped daughter are especially terrifying as you never know what is going to happen next. The only problem really is that the story can get confusing -- it took me awhile to figure out which house I was looking out of on the cover. I know that sounds lame, but it's just an example. 
A11LS12ZU93SV6 B00000G1IL June 6, 2004 1 4 4.0 Pop Returns Of course she's evil! Why else would I listen to her? Seriously though, love her or hate her, she's not a multi-platinum artist for nothing. This first CD by the now infamous Princess of Pop reintroduces a genre that seemingly had been dead since Debbie Gibson and Cyndi Lauper hung their mics up. The first song on the CD begins with background acoustics and hard piano punches and ends in an almost rock-and-roll spirit. The rest of the songs go along the same line, with Britney seemingly begging for attention, even the abusive type. All in all though, I'd say she kicked her initial album off nicely. The others are a different story. 
A11LS12ZU93SV6 B0000C9WBD October 27, 2003 6 8 4.0 POWERHOUSE This is technically the most powerful video gaming console as of October 27th, 2003. While it may not have the most or the best video games, it does have something the Gamecube and Playstation 2 don't have: a built-in hard drive. Okay, so maybe the PS2 will have a hard drive available soon, but that's another story. Anyway, the hard drive enables gamers to play their own music in select video games such as "Dead Or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball" and "Sega GT 2002". While the X-Box is more powerful than the PS2 and GC, the differences aren't that noticable -- at least to me. In fact, I thought the graphics in the Gamecube version of Soul Calibur 2 (on a playable demo disk) were somewhat more pleasing to the eyes than the X-Box version's. That's just one game though. I'd tell you more, but there's not much to tell. I believe you may get more info in that area from some of these other reviewers. My personal recommendations for X-Box are "Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat," "Dead Or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball," "Bloodrayne," and "Soul Calibur 2." On a side note, I got my X-Box when the bundle had "Jet Set Radio Future" and "Sega GT 2002". My bundle didn't include an X-Box Live trial subscription, but that would not have done me any good because I only have dial-up. I never played "Tetris Worlds Online" or "Star Wars: The Clone", so I don't have any take on those games. Also, in case you are reading this review from a source other than Amazon.com, which I found to be the case with Barbie: Treasures in Time, I must warn you if you don't already know that a DVD Playback Kit (or possibly a hacking tool) you won't be able to view DVD movies on the X-Box. A little advice: Some games (such as Dead or Alive 3 and Xtreme Beach Volleyball) can't have their data saved to a memory unit. Taking extra care of your X-Box is essential because if you ever have to replace it, you can kiss some of your saved game data goodbye. 
A11LS12ZU93SV6 B00007B77R July 27, 2003 12 13 2.0 The name says it all If not for the horrible controls, Darkened Skye would have been a great game. Unfortunately, no matter which way you set your configurations, the game remains frustrating. One of the problems is one so common in third-party Gamecube games: functions of the L&R buttons suffer from the "click only" effect, meaning you have to press them all the way in for a response. This is apparent also in BloodRayne, NAMCO Arcade Museum, and Evolution Worlds, among other titles. I don't know why third-parties do this -- it irritates the hell out of me and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Anyway, this is one of those medieval settings on no particular planet. You play as Skye, a sarcastic teenage girl on a mission to stop something-or-other. I don't mind the dumb idea of using Skittles as magic; actually I think it's kind of cute. The dry humor is almost funny too. 
A11LS12ZU93SV6 B00004U1R2 March 31, 2003 0 1 3.0 TAKE A DIVE!! THIS GAME SINKS LIKE A STONE! All the humor is this game might be amusing if not for the gawd-awful controls. Even after Conker sobers up, he still acts like he's drunk -- just like the developers. Thanks a lot, Rare!! You ruined my life!! Seriously though, I don't remember the controls being this bad, so maybe my controller's busted. The game opens with a tribute to Wendy Carlos' Clockwork Orange theme song and Conker sitting in a throne, about to explain how he became king of the land. "It was a bad fur day." Next thing you know, Conker's in a bar leaving a message on Berri's answering machine. Berri is the grey chipmunk on the right side of the cover in the pink two-piece. The control-response starts out really bad because Conker is drunk stupid. Then things clear up a bit after he talks to a marijuana plant. From there on, things just seem to get weirder. Rare wanted to make a fairy tale parody with sick humor, and that's exactly what they did. 
A11LS12ZU93SV6 0553564420 December 7, 2002 0 1 5.0 Team work among writers makes its mark No, I don't believe in cruelty to animals. That being said, I think this is one great book. Hard to read, yes, but very rewarding if you like solid sci-fi with a balanced amount of action, suspense, and drama. There are also tiny sprinkles of mystery here and there. The story begins when an African-American transport pilot (Joyce, I think her name is) makes her way to a space rock/station. There, she catches up with an old friend, both unaware that professor Ernst Kleist is up to very evil experiments. The title, Rogue, comes from a domestic alien bred by Kleist himself. That's all I'm saying cuz I don't want to spoil anything. This book is somehwat of a departure from the Alien movies (not just because Ripley's not even mentioned) but it's equally as good. Pay no attention to any ads for other books that say stuff like "If you liked Aliens Rogue...". This story is one of a kind. 
A11LS12ZU93SV6 B000035XZW November 1, 2002 1 2 3.0 Not as good as Super Street Fighter II Turbo. However . . . Street Fighter rip-offs seem to get a bad rep: video games like Fatal Fury, Fighters History, Kat Fight, and TMNT Tournament Fighters have gotten mostly bad reviews , this being one of them. Double Dragon 5 is essentially a tournament fighting game based on a short-lived cartoon series that aired around the early-to-mid 1990's. I guess you could say it's a game based on a cartoon based on a game. The animation is a bit shabby and the moves are not very easy to pull off. I really don't know what else to write about this game. Street Fighter 2 set the bar at a level few fighting games were able to reach - notable exceptions include Mortal Kombat 1&2 and the Japanese Super Famicom Dragon Ball Z series. As a result, more recent fighting games such as Eternal Champions and Double Dragon V have become underrated. 
A11LS12ZU93SV6 B00004R9HX June 1, 2002 0 0 3.0 Grappling can never replace jumping . . . I never played the original Bionic Commando, so I cannot acurately compare it to this remake. What I'm told, though, is that the female commando is new. This is essentially a mission-based side-scroller that also stems to occasional bloody sniper-modes and some omni-scrolling. The play-control is done rather well, except that you cannot jump. Instead, you have to use your grappling arm to get from one platform to another, which can make for unnecessary dificulty. There is also a lot of maze work in some levels, forcing you to run in circles before actually getting from point A to point B and so forth. As for the commandos themselves, the "Johnny Knocksville" male commando and the "X-Woman Psylocke" female differ only in looks. The choice is probably based on your preference for gender. I usually play as the female even though I'm male, but maybe that's just me. The storyline is simple: a former bionic commando loses his temper and decides he wants to destroy the government that created him. At least that's what I remember. You are a new commando sent to stop the evil cyborg at all costs. As you progress, you will collect new weapons and items. Most of the items are merely requirements to complete your mission while the new weapons simply make you more powerful. You may also collect other enhancements such as a pair of steel boots to knock your enemies out while swinging. 
A11LTANJ1RZRI1 B0006281RG October 5, 2005 1 1 4.0 A good choice for everyday use There is enough room in the outside pocket, and a mesh pocket inside the top cover, for memory cards, an extra battery, even the USB cable. A set of two belt loops would feel more secure than the single centered belt loop provided. I still want a larger belt pack (or small backpack) that will accommodate the camera, accessories, and other supplies for an all day outing. 
A11LTANJ1RZRI1 B00006JN0E September 3, 2003 0 0 5.0 Beautiful Images and Practical Too. The bird images on these mugs are colorful and very detailed. Consider buying these large mugs instead of the standard teacups. 
A11MIUF8419YO6 1561708607 April 25, 2002 13 13 5.0 Messages from the Angels for Today! I just received my copy of Messages from Your Angels and I was really surprised at just how much information is contained in this book. I have read Angel Therapy, Healing with the Angels, Manifesting with the Angels, Chakra clearing with the Angels, Divine Guidance (all by Doreen Virtue) but this one is incredible! The first part of the book is very similar to Angel Therapy, where you have many different topics to open up to or just read as you feel led. Next it moves on to messages from Archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel. There's a Question and Answer section with questions ranging from "Is this person my soul mate?" "How do I know if my deceased love one is okay?" From here it brings in many of the key messages for discerning between Angelic voices and Lower Realm Earth-bound souls commonly found in Divine Guidance. If you are just starting out with exploring Angels or interested in learning how to talk with Angels or just to find answers to some of your questions, this is a great book to start with! Think of it as a sampler of Doreen's works, taking the best parts and combining them all in one book! I have only skimmed through the many sections reading some here and there and I have been very impressed and pleased that this book is so much more than just another Angel Therapy book. It's an Angel Therapy book, a Divine Guidance Book, a communing with the Angels book, a book for healing and spiritual/personal growth. A book to consult over and over again. 
A11MNKGD2VLZOB 0399511938 October 5, 2003 0 0 5.0 If you like Martin Mull buy this book. This is a very funny book. Read the book, then try to find the video in VHS. 
A11MNKGD2VLZOB 0226044378 December 30, 2001 4 9 5.0 Top Flight This is an excellent book that explains the need for patriots. It traces the concept of patriotism from Sparta throught the Founding to current times. Of particular interest is its discuss of why Frederick Douglass felt that before a black man could become a citizen, he should first serve as a soldier. It discusses why the Founders realized the critical need for patriots, while at the same time not holding out much hope for such people. I strongly recommend this book, especially in light of current events. 
A11MNKGD2VLZOB 0873646533 June 18, 2000 3 9 5.0 An enjoyable and informative book I enjoyed this book. I found the mix of actual events and science to be about right. It is full of useful information. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who takes their self-defense seriously.
